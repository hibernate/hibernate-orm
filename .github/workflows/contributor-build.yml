# The main CI of Hibernate ORM is https://ci.hibernate.org/job/hibernate-orm-5.6-h2/.
# However, Hibernate ORM builds run on GitHub actions regularly
# to check that it still works and can be used in GitHub forks.
# See https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions
# for more information about GitHub actions.
