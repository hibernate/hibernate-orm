= Attributes (and inheritance)


[source]
----
class Customer {
    Integer id;
    String name;
    Address address;
    int quota;
}

class DomesticCustomer extends Customer {
    String taxId;
    String attr1;
    String attr2;
}

class ForeignCustomer extends Customer {
    String vat;
    String attr3;
    String attr4;
}

The general idea is that the attributes are ordered alphabetically, super attributes first.  Subtypes are sorted
depth-first and the attributes are sorted alphabetically within each subtype.  So the order of the attributes
depends on where we start.

Starting from Customer we have: `[address, name, quota, attr1, attr2, taxId, attr3, attr4, vat]`
Starting from DomesticCustomer we have: `[address, name, quota, attr1, attr2]`
Starting from ForeignCustomer we have: `[address, name, quota, attr3, attr4, vat]`

This is why we cannot really have the position be an inherent part of the attribute itself - it changes depending on
where we start.
