    <title>Batch processing</title>
    
    <para>
        A naive approach to inserting 100 000 rows in the database using Hibernate might 
        look like this:
    </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
Transaction tx = session.beginTransaction();
for ( int i=0; i<100000; i++ ) {
    Customer customer = new Customer(.....);
    session.save(customer);
}
tx.commit();
session.close();]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        This would fall over with an <literal>OutOfMemoryException</literal> somewhere 
        around the 50 000th row. That's because Hibernate caches all the newly inserted 
        <literal>Customer</literal> instances in the session-level cache. 
    </para>

    <para>
        In this chapter we'll show you how to avoid this problem. First, however, if you
        are doing batch processing, it is absolutely critical that you enable the use of
        JDBC batching, if you intend to achieve reasonable performance. Set the JDBC batch 
        size to a reasonable number (say, 10-50):

        Note that Hibernate disables insert batching at the JDBC level transparently if you
        use an <literal>identiy</literal> identifier generator.
    </para>

    <para>
        You also might like to do this kind of work in a process where interaction with 
        the second-level cache is completely disabled:
    </para>

<programlisting><![CDATA[hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache false]]></programlisting>

    <para>
        However, this is not absolutely necessary, since we can explicitly set the
        <literal>CacheMode</literal> to disable interaction with the second-level cache.

        <para>
            When making new objects persistent, you must <literal>flush()</literal> and 
            then <literal>clear()</literal> the session regularly, to control the size of
            the first-level cache.

    session.save(customer);
    if ( i % 20 == 0 ) { //20, same as the JDBC batch size
        //flush a batch of inserts and release memory:
        session.flush();

        <para>
            For retrieving and updating data the same ideas apply. In addition, you need to 
            use <literal>scroll()</literal> to take advantage of server-side cursors for 
            queries that return many rows of data.

while ( customers.next() ) {
    Customer customer = (Customer) customers.get(0);
    customer.updateStuff(...);
    if ( ++count % 20 == 0 ) {
        //flush a batch of updates and release memory:

        <title>The StatelessSession interface</title>
        <para>
            Alternatively, Hibernate provides a command-oriented API that may be used for 
            streaming data to and from the database in the form of detached objects. A 
            <literal>StatelessSession</literal> has no persistence context associated
            with it and does not provide many of the higher-level life cycle semantics.
            In particular, a stateless session does not implement a first-level cache nor
            interact with any second-level or query cache. It does not implement 
            transactional write-behind or automatic dirty checking. Operations performed
            using a stateless session do not ever cascade to associated instances. Collections 
            are ignored by a stateless session. Operations performed via a stateless session 
            bypass Hibernate's event model and interceptors. Stateless sessions are vulnerable 
            to data aliasing effects, due to the lack of a first-level cache. A stateless
            session is a lower-level abstraction, much closer to the underlying JDBC.
        </para>
        
<programlisting><![CDATA[StatelessSession session = sessionFactory.openStatelessSession();

ScrollableResults customers = session.getNamedQuery("GetCustomers")

while ( customers.next() ) {
    Customer customer = (Customer) customers.get(0);

        <para>
            Note that in this code example, the <literal>Customer</literal> instances returned
            by the query are immediately detached. They are never associated with any persistence
            context.

            The <literal>insert(), update()</literal> and <literal>delete()</literal> operations
            defined by the <literal>StatelessSession</literal> interface are considered to be
            direct database row-level operations, which result in immediate execution of a SQL
            <literal>INSERT, UPDATE</literal> or <literal>DELETE</literal> respectively. Thus,
            they have very different semantics to the <literal>save(), saveOrUpdate()</literal>

            interface.

        <title>DML-style operations</title>

        <para>
            As already discussed, automatic and transparent object/relational mapping is concerned
            with the management of object state. This implies that the object state is available
            in memory, hence manipulating (using the SQL <literal>Data Manipulation Language</literal>
            (DML) statements: <literal>INSERT</literal>, <literal>UPDATE</literal>, <literal>DELETE</literal>)
            data directly in the database will not affect in-memory state. However, Hibernate provides methods
            for bulk SQL-style DML statement execution which are performed through the
            Hibernate Query Language (<xref linkend="queryhql">HQL</xref>).

            The pseudo-syntax for <literal>UPDATE</literal> and <literal>DELETE</literal> statements

            HQL <literal>UPDATE</literal> statements, by default do not effect the

            or the <xref linkend="mapping-declaration-timestamp">timestamp</xref> property values
            for the affected entities; this is in keeping with the EJB3 specification.  However,
            you can force Hibernate to properly reset the <literal>version</literal> or
            <literal>timestamp</literal> property values through the use of a <literal>versioned update</literal>.
            This is achieved by adding the <literal>VERSIONED</literal> keyword after the <literal>UPDATE</literal>
            keyword.

            The <literal>int</literal> value returned by the <literal>Query.executeUpdate()</literal>

            correlate to the number of rows effected in the database.  An HQL bulk operation might result in
            multiple actual SQL statements being executed, for joined-subclass, for example.  The returned
            number indicates the number of actual entities affected by the statement.  Going back to the
            example of joined-subclass, a delete against one of the subclasses may actually result
            in deletes against not just the table to which that subclass is mapped, but also the "root"
            table and potentially joined-subclass tables further down the inheritence hierarchy.

                    inheritence, only properties directly defined on that given class-level can be
                    used in the properties_list.  Superclass properties are not allowed; and subclass

                    select_statement can be any valid HQL select query, with the caveat that the return types
                    must match the types expected by the insert.  Currently, this is checked during query
                    compilation rather than allowing the check to relegate to the database.  Note however
                    that this might cause problems between Hibernate <literal>Type</literal>s which are
                    <emphasis>equivalent</emphasis> as opposed to <emphasis>equal</emphasis>.  This might cause
                    issues with mismatches between a property defined as a <literal>org.hibernate.type.DateType</literal>
                    and a property defined as a <literal>org.hibernate.type.TimestampType</literal>, even though the
                    database might not make a distinction or might be able to handle the conversion.

                    For the id property, the insert statement gives you two options.  You can either
                    explicitly specify the id property in the properties_list (in which case its value
                    is taken from the corresponding select expression) or omit it from the properties_list
                    (in which case a generated value is used).  This later option is only available when
                    using id generators that operate in the database; attempting to use this option with
                    any "in memory" type generators will cause an exception during parsing.  Note that
                    for the purposes of this discussion, in-database generators are considered to be
                    <literal>org.hibernate.id.SequenceGenerator</literal> (and its subclasses) and
                    any implementors of <literal>org.hibernate.id.PostInsertIdentifierGenerator</literal>.
                    The most notable exception here is <literal>org.hibernate.id.TableHiLoGenerator</literal>,
                    which cannot be used because it does not expose a selectable way to get its values.
