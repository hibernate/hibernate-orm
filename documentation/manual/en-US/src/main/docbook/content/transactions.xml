    <title>Transactions And Concurrency</title>

    <para>
        The most important point about Hibernate and concurrency control is that it is very
        easy to understand. Hibernate directly uses JDBC connections and JTA resources without
        adding any additional locking behavior. We highly recommend you spend some time with the
        JDBC, ANSI, and transaction isolation specification of your database management system.
    </para>

    <para>
        Hibernate does not lock objects in memory. Your application can expect the behavior as
        defined by the isolation level of your database transactions. Note that thanks to the
        <literal>Session</literal>, which is also a transaction-scoped cache, Hibernate
        provides repeatable reads for lookup by identifier and entity queries (not
        reporting queries that return scalar values).
    </para>

    <para>
        In addition to versioning for automatic optimistic concurrency control, Hibernate also
        offers a (minor) API for pessimistic locking of rows, using the
        <literal>SELECT FOR UPDATE</literal> syntax. Optimistic concurrency control and
        this API are discussed later in this chapter.
    </para>

    <para>
        We start the discussion of concurrency control in Hibernate with the granularity of
        <literal>Configuration</literal>, <literal>SessionFactory</literal>, and
        <literal>Session</literal>, as well as database transactions and long conversations.
    </para>

        <title>Session and transaction scopes</title>

        <para>
            A <literal>SessionFactory</literal> is an expensive-to-create, threadsafe object 
            intended to be shared by all application threads. It is created once, usually on
            application startup, from a <literal>Configuration</literal> instance.
        </para>

        <para>
            A <literal>Session</literal> is an inexpensive, non-threadsafe object that should be
            used once, for a single request, a conversation, single unit of work, and then discarded.
            A <literal>Session</literal> will not obtain a JDBC <literal>Connection</literal>
            (or a <literal>Datasource</literal>) unless it is needed, hence consume no
            resources until used.
        </para>

        <para>
            To complete this picture you also have to think about database transactions. A
            database transaction has to be as short as possible, to reduce lock contention in
            the database. Long database transactions will prevent your application from scaling
            to highly concurrent load. Hence, it is almost never good design to hold a
            database transaction open during user think time, until the unit of work is
            complete.
        </para>

        <para>
            What is the scope of a unit of work? Can a single Hibernate <literal>Session</literal>
            span several database transactions or is this a one-to-one relationship of scopes? When
            should you open and close a <literal>Session</literal> and how do you demarcate the
            database transaction boundaries?
        </para>

            <title>Unit of work</title>

            <para>
                First, don't use the <emphasis>session-per-operation</emphasis> antipattern, that is,
                don't open and close a <literal>Session</literal> for every simple database call in
                a single thread! Of course, the same is true for database transactions. Database calls
                in an application are made using a planned sequence, they are grouped into atomic
                units of work. (Note that this also means that auto-commit after every single
                SQL statement is useless in an application, this mode is intended for ad-hoc SQL
                console work. Hibernate disables, or expects the application server to do so,
                auto-commit mode immediately.) Database transactions are never optional, all
                communication with a database has to occur inside a transaction, no matter if
                you read or write data. As explained, auto-commit behavior for reading data
                should be avoided, as many small transactions are unlikely to perform better than
                one clearly defined unit of work. The latter is also much more maintainable
                and extensible.
            </para>

            <para>
                The most common pattern in a multi-user client/server application is
                <emphasis>session-per-request</emphasis>. In this model, a request from the client
                is send to the server (where the Hibernate persistence layer runs), a new Hibernate
                <literal>Session</literal> is opened, and all database operations are executed in this unit
                of work. Once the work has been completed (and the response for the client has been prepared),
                the session is flushed and closed. You would also use a single database transaction to
                serve the clients request, starting and committing it when you open and close the
                <literal>Session</literal>. The relationship between the two is one-to-one and this
                model is a perfect fit for many applications.
            </para>

            <para>
                The challenge lies in the implementation. Hibernate provides built-in management of
                the "current session" to simplify this pattern. All you have to do is start a
                transaction when a server request has to be processed, and end the transaction
                before the response is send to the client. You can do this in any way you
                like, common solutions are <literal>ServletFilter</literal>, AOP interceptor with a
                pointcut on the service methods, or a proxy/interception container. An EJB container
                is a standardized way to implement cross-cutting aspects such as transaction
                demarcation on EJB session beans, declaratively with CMT. If you decide to
                use programmatic transaction demarcation, prefer the Hibernate <literal>Transaction</literal>
                API shown later in this chapter, for ease of use and code portability.
            </para>

            <para>
                Your application code can access a "current session" to process the request
                by simply calling <literal>sessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</literal> anywhere
                and as often as needed. You will always get a <literal>Session</literal> scoped
                to the current database transaction. This has to be configured for either
                resource-local or JTA environments, see <xref linkend="architecture-current-session"/>.
            </para>

            <para>
                Sometimes it is convenient to extend the scope of a <literal>Session</literal> and
                database transaction until the "view has been rendered". This is especially useful
                in servlet applications that utilize a separate rendering phase after the request
                has been processed. Extending the database transaction until view rendering is
                complete is easy to do if you implement your own interceptor. However, it is not
                easily doable if you rely on EJBs with container-managed transactions, as a
                transaction will be completed when an EJB method returns, before rendering of any
                view can start. See the Hibernate website and forum for tips and examples around
                this <emphasis>Open Session in View</emphasis> pattern.

                The session-per-request pattern is not the only useful concept you can use to design
                units of work. Many business processes require a whole series of interactions with the user
                interleaved with database accesses. In web and enterprise applications it is
                not acceptable for a database transaction to span a user interaction. Consider the following
                example:
            </para>

                    <para>
                        The first screen of a dialog opens, the data seen by the user has been loaded in
                        a particular <literal>Session</literal> and database transaction. The user is free to
                        modify the objects.

                    <para>
                        The user clicks "Save" after 5 minutes and expects his modifications to be made
                        persistent; he also expects that he was the only person editing this information and
                        that no conflicting modification can occur.
                    </para>

            </itemizedlist>

            <para>
                We call this unit of work, from the point of view of the user, a long running
                <emphasis>conversation</emphasis> (or <emphasis>application transaction</emphasis>).
                There are many ways how you can implement this in your application.
            </para>

            <para>
                A first naive implementation might keep the <literal>Session</literal> and database
                transaction open during user think time, with locks held in the database to prevent
                concurrent modification, and to guarantee isolation and atomicity. This is of course
                an anti-pattern, since lock contention would not allow the application to scale with
                the number of concurrent users.
            </para>

            <para>
                Clearly, we have to use several database transactions to implement the converastion.
                In this case, maintaining isolation of business processes becomes the
                partial responsibility of the application tier. A single conversation
                usually spans several database transactions. It will be atomic if only one of
                these database transactions (the last one) stores the updated data, all others
                simply read data (e.g. in a wizard-style dialog spanning several request/response
                cycles). This is easier to implement than it might sound, especially if
                you use Hibernate's features:

                        if a concurrent modification occured during user think time. Usually
                        we only check at the end of the conversation.

                        reattach the objects and persist the modifications, the pattern is called
                        <emphasis>session-per-request-with-detached-objects</emphasis>. Automatic
                        versioning is used to isolate concurrent modifications.

                        when a new client request occurs. This pattern is known as
                        <emphasis>session-per-conversation</emphasis> and makes
                        even reattachment unnecessary. Automatic versioning is used to isolate
                        concurrent modifications and the <literal>Session</literal> is usually
                        not allowed to be flushed automatically, but explicitely.

            <title>Considering object identity</title>

            <para>
                An application may concurrently access the same persistent state in two
                different <literal>Session</literal>s. However, an instance of a persistent class
                is never shared between two <literal>Session</literal> instances. Hence there are
                two different notions of identity:
            </para>

            <variablelist spacing="compact">

            </variablelist>

            <para>
                Then for objects attached to a <emphasis>particular</emphasis> <literal>Session</literal>
                (i.e. in the scope of a <literal>Session</literal>) the two notions are equivalent, and
                JVM identity for database identity is guaranteed by Hibernate. However, while the application
                might concurrently access the "same" (persistent identity) business object in two different
                sessions, the two instances will actually be "different" (JVM identity). Conflicts are
                resolved using (automatic versioning) at flush/commit time, using an optimistic approach.
            </para>

            <para>
                This approach leaves Hibernate and the database to worry about concurrency; it also provides
                the best scalability, since guaranteeing identity in single-threaded units of work only doesn't
                need expensive locking or other means of synchronization. The application never needs to
                synchronize on any business object, as long as it sticks to a single thread per
                <literal>Session</literal>. Within a <literal>Session</literal> the  application may safely use
                <literal>==</literal> to compare objects.
            </para>

            <para>
                However, an application that uses <literal>==</literal> outside of a <literal>Session</literal>,
                might see unexpected results. This might occur even in some unexpected places, for example,
                if you put two detached instances into the same <literal>Set</literal>. Both might have the same
                database identity (i.e. they represent the same row), but JVM identity is by definition not
                guaranteed for instances in detached state. The developer has to override the <literal>equals()</literal>
                and <literal>hashCode()</literal> methods in persistent classes and implement
                his own notion of object equality. There is one caveat: Never use the database
                identifier to implement equality, use a business key, a combination of unique, usually
                immutable, attributes. The database identifier will change if a transient object is made
                persistent. If the transient instance (usually together with detached instances) is held in a
                <literal>Set</literal>, changing the hashcode breaks the contract of the <literal>Set</literal>.
                Attributes for business keys don't have to be as stable as database primary keys, you only
                have to guarantee stability as long as the objects are in the same <literal>Set</literal>. See
                the Hibernate website for a more thorough discussion of this issue. Also note that this is not
                a Hibernate issue, but simply how Java object identity and equality has to be implemented.

                        later), you should consider synchronizing access to your Http session. Otherwise,
                        a user that clicks reload fast enough may use the same <literal>Session</literal> in
                        two concurrently running threads.

                        An exception thrown by Hibernate means you have to rollback your database transaction

                        If your <literal>Session</literal> is bound to the application, you have to stop
                        the application. Rolling back the database transaction doesn't put your business
                        objects back into the state they were at the start of the transaction. This means the
                        database state and the business objects do get out of sync. Usually this is not a
                        problem, because exceptions are not recoverable and you have to start over after
                        rollback anyway.

                        get an OutOfMemoryException, if you keep it open for a long time or simply load too
                        much data. One solution for this is to call <literal>clear()</literal> and <literal>evict()</literal>
                        to manage the <literal>Session</literal> cache, but you most likely should consider a
                        Stored Procedure if you need mass data operations. Some solutions are shown in
                        <xref linkend="batch"/>. Keeping a <literal>Session</literal> open for the duration
                        of a user session also means a high probability of stale data.

        <title>Database transaction demarcation</title>

        <para>
            Datatabase (or system) transaction boundaries are always necessary. No communication with
            the database can occur outside of a database transaction (this seems to confuse many developers
            who are used to the auto-commit mode). Always use clear transaction boundaries, even for
            read-only operations. Depending on your isolation level and database capabilities this might not
            be required but there is no downside if you always demarcate transactions explicitly. Certainly,
            a single database transaction is going to perform better than many small transactions, even
            for reading data.
        </para>

        <para>
            A Hibernate application can run in non-managed (i.e. standalone, simple Web- or Swing applications)
            and managed J2EE environments. In a non-managed environment, Hibernate is usually responsible for
            its own database connection pool. The application developer has to manually set transaction
            boundaries, in other words, begin, commit, or rollback database transactions himself. A managed environment
            usually provides container-managed transactions (CMT), with the transaction assembly defined declaratively
            in deployment descriptors of EJB session beans, for example. Programmatic transaction demarcation is
            then no longer necessary.
        </para>

        <para>
            However, it is often desirable to keep your persistence layer portable between non-managed
            resource-local environments, and systems that can rely on JTA but use BMT instead of CMT.
            In both cases you'd use programmatic transaction demaracation. Hibernate offers a wrapper
            API called <literal>Transaction</literal> that translates into the native transaction system of
            your deployment environment. This API is actually optional, but we strongly encourage its use
            unless you are in a CMT session bean.

            <para>
                One extremely important feature provided by a managed environment like EJB
                that is never provided for non-managed code is transaction timeout. Transaction
                timeouts ensure that no misbehaving transaction can indefinitely tie up 
                resources while returning no response to the user. Outside a managed (JTA)
                environment, Hibernate cannot fully provide this functionality. However,
                Hibernate can at least control data access operations, ensuring that database
                level deadlocks and queries with huge result sets are limited by a defined
                timeout. In a managed environment, Hibernate can delegate transaction timeout
                to JTA. This functioanlity is abstracted by the Hibernate 
                <literal>Transaction</literal> object.

            The only approach that is consistent with high concurrency and high
            scalability is optimistic concurrency control with versioning. Version
            checking uses version numbers, or timestamps, to detect conflicting updates
            (and to prevent lost updates). Hibernate provides for three possible approaches
            to writing application code that uses optimistic concurrency. The use cases
            we show are in the context of long conversations, but version checking
            also has the benefit of preventing lost updates in single database transactions.

                conversation transaction isolation. This approach is the least efficient in terms of
                database access. It is the approach most similar to entity EJBs.

                check. In that case, <emphasis>last commit wins</emphasis> will be the default
                strategy for your long conversations. Keep in mind that this might
                confuse the users of the application, as they might experience lost updates without
                error messages or a chance to merge conflicting changes.
            </para>

            <para>
                Clearly, manual version checking is only feasible in very trivial circumstances
                and not practical for most applications. Often not only single instances, but
                complete graphs of modified ojects have to be checked. Hibernate offers automatic
                version checking with either an extended <literal>Session</literal> or detached instances
                as the design paradigm.

                A single <literal>Session</literal> instance and its persistent instances are
                used for the whole conversation, known as <emphasis>session-per-conversation</emphasis>.
                Hibernate checks instance versions at flush time, throwing an exception if concurrent
                modification is detected. It's up to the developer to catch and handle this exception
                (common options are the opportunity for the user to merge changes or to restart the
                business conversation with non-stale data).
            </para>

            <para>
                The <literal>Session</literal> is disconnected from any underlying JDBC connection
                when waiting for user interaction. This approach is the most efficient in terms
                of database access. The application need not concern itself with version checking or
                with reattaching detached instances, nor does it have to reload instances in every
                database transaction.
            </para>

            <programlisting><![CDATA[// foo is an instance loaded earlier by the old session
Transaction t = session.beginTransaction(); // Obtain a new JDBC connection, start transaction

foo.setProperty("bar");

session.flush();    // Only for last transaction in conversation
t.commit();         // Also return JDBC connection
session.close();    // Only for last transaction in conversation]]></programlisting>
            <para>
                The <literal>foo</literal> object still knows which <literal>Session</literal> it was
                loaded in. Beginning a new database transaction on an old session obtains a new connection
                and resumes the session. Committing a database transaction disconnects a session
                from the JDBC connection and returns the connection to the pool. After reconnection, to
                force a version check on data  you aren't updating, you may call <literal>Session.lock()</literal>
                with <literal>LockMode.READ</literal> on any objects that might have been updated by another
                transaction. You don't need to lock any data that you <emphasis>are</emphasis> updating.
                Usually you would set <literal>FlushMode.MANUAL</literal> on an extended <literal>Session</literal>,
                so that only the last database transaction cycle is allowed to actually persist all
                modifications made in this conversation. Hence, only this last database transaction
                would include the <literal>flush()</literal> operation, and then also
                <literal>close()</literal> the session to end the conversation.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                This pattern is problematic if the <literal>Session</literal> is too big to
                be stored during user think time, e.g. an <literal>HttpSession</literal> should
                be kept as small as possible. As the <literal>Session</literal> is also the
                (mandatory) first-level cache and contains all loaded objects, we can probably
                use this strategy only for a few request/response cycles. You should use a
                <literal>Session</literal> only for a single conversation, as it will soon also
                have stale data.
            </para>

            <para>
                (Note that earlier Hibernate versions required explicit disconnection and reconnection
                of a <literal>Session</literal>. These methods are deprecated, as beginning and
                ending a transaction has the same effect.)
            </para>

            <para>
                Also note that you should keep the disconnected <literal>Session</literal> close
                to the persistence layer. In other words, use an EJB stateful session bean to
                hold the <literal>Session</literal> in a three-tier environment, and don't transfer
                it to the web layer (or even serialize it to a separate tier) to store it in the
                <literal>HttpSession</literal>.
            </para>

            <para>
                The extended session pattern, or <emphasis>session-per-conversation</emphasis>, is
                more difficult to implement with automatic current session context management.
                You need to supply your own implementation of the <literal>CurrentSessionContext</literal>
                for this, see the Hibernate Wiki for examples.

                Each interaction with the persistent store occurs in a new <literal>Session</literal>.
                However, the same persistent instances are reused for each interaction with the database.
                The application manipulates the state of detached instances originally loaded in another

                You may also call <literal>lock()</literal> instead of <literal>update()</literal>

            <para>
                You may disable Hibernate's automatic version increment for particular properties and 
                collections by setting the <literal>optimistic-lock</literal> mapping attribute to 
                <literal>false</literal>. Hibernate will then no longer increment versions if the 
                property is dirty.
            </para>

            <para>
                Legacy database schemas are often static and can't be modified. Or, other applications
                might also access the same database and don't know how to handle version numbers or
                even timestamps. In both cases, versioning can't rely on a particular column in a table.
                To force a version check without a version or timestamp property mapping, with a
                comparison of the state of all fields in a row, turn on <literal>optimistic-lock="all"</literal>
                in the <literal>&lt;class&gt;</literal> mapping. Note that this concepetually only works
                if Hibernate can compare the old and new state, i.e. if you use a single long
                <literal>Session</literal> and not session-per-request-with-detached-objects.
            </para>

            <para>
                Sometimes concurrent modification can be permitted as long as the changes that have been
                made don't overlap. If you set <literal>optimistic-lock="dirty"</literal> when mapping the
                <literal>&lt;class&gt;</literal>, Hibernate will only compare dirty fields during flush.
            </para>

            <para>
                In both cases, with dedicated version/timestamp columns or with full/dirty field
                comparison, Hibernate uses a single <literal>UPDATE</literal> statement (with an
                appropriate <literal>WHERE</literal> clause) per entity to execute the version check
                and update the information. If you use transitive persistence to cascade reattachment
                to associated entities, Hibernate might execute uneccessary updates. This is usually
                not a problem, but <emphasis>on update</emphasis> triggers in the database might be
                executed even when no changes have been made to detached instances. You can customize
                this behavior by setting  <literal>select-before-update="true"</literal> in the
                <literal>&lt;class&gt;</literal> mapping, forcing Hibernate to <literal>SELECT</literal>
                the instance to ensure that changes did actually occur, before updating the row.

            The legacy (2.x) behavior of Hibernate in regards to JDBC connection management
            was that a <literal>Session</literal> would obtain a connection when it was first
            needed and then hold unto that connection until the session was closed.
            Hibernate 3.x introduced the notion of connection release modes to tell a session
            how to handle its JDBC connections.  Note that the following discussion is pertinent
            only to connections provided through a configured <literal>ConnectionProvider</literal>;
            user-supplied connections are outside the breadth of this discussion.  The different
