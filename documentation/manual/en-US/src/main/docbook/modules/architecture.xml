        <para>
            A (very) high-level view of the Hibernate architecture:

        <para>
            This diagram shows Hibernate using the database and configuration data to
            provide persistence services (and persistent objects) to the application.
        </para>

        <para>
            We would like to show a more detailed view of the runtime architecture.
            Unfortunately, Hibernate is flexible and supports several approaches. We will
            show the two extremes. The "lite" architecture has the application
            provide its own JDBC connections and manage its own transactions. This approach
            uses a minimal subset of Hibernate's APIs:

        </mediaobject>

        <para>
            The "full cream" architecture abstracts the application away from the
            underlying JDBC/JTA APIs and lets Hibernate take care of the details.

                        <emphasis>guarantees</emphasis> that persistent identity

        <title>Contextual Sessions</title>
        <para>
            Most applications using Hibernate need some form of "contextual" sessions, where a given
            session is in effect throughout the scope of a given context. However, across applications
            the definition of what constitutes a context is typically different; and different contexts
            define different scopes to the notion of current. Applications using Hibernate prior
            to version 3.0 tended to utilize either home-grown <literal>ThreadLocal</literal>-based
            contextual sessions, helper classes such as <literal>HibernateUtil</literal>, or utilized
            third-party frameworks (such as Spring or Pico) which provided proxy/interception-based contextual sessions.
        </para>
        <para>
            Starting with version 3.0.1, Hibernate added the <literal>SessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</literal>
            method.  Initially, this assumed usage of <literal>JTA</literal> transactions, where the
            <literal>JTA</literal> transaction defined both the scope and context of a current session.
            The Hibernate team maintains that, given the maturity of the numerous stand-alone
            <literal>JTA TransactionManager</literal> implementations out there, most (if not all)
            applications should be using <literal>JTA</literal> transaction management whether or not
            they are deployed into a <literal>J2EE</literal> container.  Based on that, the
            <literal>JTA</literal>-based contextual sessions is all you should ever need to use.
        </para>
        <para>
            However, as of version 3.1, the processing behind
            <literal>SessionFactory.getCurrentSession()</literal> is now pluggable.  To that
            end, a new extension interface (<literal>org.hibernate.context.CurrentSessionContext</literal>)
            and a new configuration parameter (<literal>hibernate.current_session_context_class</literal>)
            have been added to allow pluggability of the scope and context of defining current sessions.
        </para>
        <para>
            See the Javadocs for the <literal>org.hibernate.context.CurrentSessionContext</literal>
            interface for a detailed discussion of its contract.  It defines a single method,
            <literal>currentSession()</literal>, by which the implementation is responsible for
            tracking the current contextual session.  Out-of-the-box, Hibernate comes with three
            implementations of this interface.

                    here is exactly the same as in the older JTA-only approach.  See the Javadocs

                    on this class, it does never open, flush, or close a <literal>Session</literal>.

            The first two implementations provide a "one session - one database transaction" programming
            model, also known and used as <emphasis>session-per-request</emphasis>. The beginning
            and end of a Hibernate session is defined by the duration of a database transaction.
            If you use programatic transaction demarcation in plain JSE without JTA, you are adviced to
            use the Hibernate <literal>Transaction</literal> API to hide the underlying transaction system
            from your code. If you use JTA, use the JTA interfaces to demarcate transactions. If you
            execute in an EJB container that supports CMT, transaction boundaries are defined declaratively
            and you don't need any transaction or session demarcation operations in your code.
            Refer to <xref linkend="transactions"/> for more information and code examples.

        <para>
            The <literal>hibernate.current_session_context_class</literal> configuration parameter
            defines which <literal>org.hibernate.context.CurrentSessionContext</literal> implementation
            should be used.  Note that for backwards compatibility, if this config param is not set
            but a <literal>org.hibernate.transaction.TransactionManagerLookup</literal> is configured,
            Hibernate will use the <literal>org.hibernate.context.JTASessionContext</literal>.
            Typically, the value of this parameter would just name the implementation class to
            use; for the three out-of-the-box implementations, however, there are three corresponding
            short names, "jta", "thread", and "managed".
