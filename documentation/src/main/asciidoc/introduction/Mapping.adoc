[[object-relational-mapping]]
== Object/relational mapping

Given a domain model‚Äîthat is, a collection of entity classes decorated with all the fancy annotations we <<entities-summary,just met>> in the previous chapter‚ÄîHibernate will happily go away and infer a complete relational schema, and even <<automatic-schema-export,export it to your database>> if you ask politely.

The resulting schema will be entirely sane and reasonable, though if you look closely, you'll find some flaws.
For example, by default, every `VARCHAR` column will have the same length, `VARCHAR(255)`.

But the process I just described‚Äîwhich we call _top down_ mapping‚Äîsimply doesn't fit the most common scenario for the use of O/R mapping.
It's only rarely that the Java classes precede the relational schema.
Usually, _we already have a relational schema_, and we're constructing our domain model around the schema.
This is called _bottom up_ mapping.

[TIP]
// ."Legacy" data
====
Developers often refer to a pre-existing relational database as "legacy" data.
This tends to conjure images of bad old "legacy apps" written in COBOL or something.
But legacy data is valuable, and learning to work with it is important.
====

Especially when mapping bottom up, we often need to customize the inferred object/relational mappings.
This is a somewhat tedious topic, and so we don't want to spend too many words on it.
Instead, we'll quickly skim the most important mapping annotations.

[[case-convention]]
.Hibernate SQL case convention
****
Computers have had lowercase letters for rather a long time now.
Most developers learned long ago that text written in MixedCase, camelCase, or even snake_case is easier to read than text written in SHOUTYCASE.
This is just as true of SQL as it is of any other language.

Therefore, for over twenty years, the convention on the Hibernate project has been that:

- query language identifiers are written in `lowercase`,
- table names are written in `MixedCase`, and
- column names are written in `camelCase`.

That is to say, we simply adopted Java's excellent conventions and applied them to SQL.

Now, there's no way we can force you to follow this convention, even if we wished to.
Hell, you can easily write a `PhysicalNamingStrategy` which makes table and column names ALL UGLY AND SHOUTY LIKE THIS IF YOU PREFER.
But, _by default_, it's the convention Hibernate follows, and it's frankly a pretty reasonable one.

[[mapping-inheritance]]
=== Mapping entity inheritance hierarchies

In <<entity-inheritance>> we saw that entity classes may exist within an inheritance hierarchy.
There's three basic strategies for mapping an entity hierarchy to relational tables.
Let's put them in a table, so we can more easily compare the points of difference between them.

.Entity inheritance mapping strategies
|===
| Strategy | Mapping | Polymorphic queries | Constraints | Normalization | When to use it

| `SINGLE_TABLE`
| Map every class in the hierarchy to the same table, and uses the value of a _discriminator column_ to determine which concrete class each row represents.
| To retrieve instances of a given class, we only need to query the one table.
| Attributes declared by subclasses map to columns without `NOT NULL` constraints, and so their non-nullability is enforced via a `CHECK` constraint.

  Any association may have a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint. ü§ì
| Subclass data is denormalized. üßê
| Works well when subclasses declare few or no additional attributes.
| `JOINED`
| Map every class in the hierarchy to a separate table, but each table only maps the attributes declared by the class itself.

  Optionally, a discriminator column may be used.
a| To retrieve instances of a given class, we must `JOIN` the table mapped by the class with:

  - all tables mapped by its superclasses and
  - all tables mapped by its subclasses.
| Any attribute may map to a column with a `NOT NULL` constraint. ü§ì

  Any association may have a `FOREIGN KEY` constraint. ü§ì
| The tables are normalized. ü§ì
| The best option when we care a lot about constraints and normalization.
| `TABLE_PER_CLASS`
| Map every concrete class in the hierarchy to a separate table, but denormalize all inherited attributes into the table.
| To retrieve instances of a given class, we must take a `UNION` over the table mapped by the class and the tables mapped by its subclasses.
| Associations targeting a superclass cannot have a corresponding `FOREIGN KEY` constraint in the database. üíÄüíÄ

  Any attribute may map to a column with a `NOT NULL` constraint. ü§ì
| Superclass data is denormalized. üßê
| Not very popular.

  From a certain point of view, competes with `@MappedSuperclass`.
|===

The three mapping strategies are enumerated by `InheritanceType`.
We specify an inheritance mapping strategy using the `@Inheritance` annotation.

For mappings with a _discriminator column_, we should:

- specify the discriminator column name and type by annotating the root entity `@DiscriminatorColumn`, and
- specify the values of this discriminator by annotating each entity in the hierarchy `@DiscriminatorValue`.

// [[single-table-inheritance]]
// === Single table inheritance

For single table inheritance we always need a discriminator:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@DiscriminatorColumn(discriminatorType=CHAR, name="kind")
@DiscriminatorValue('P')
class Person { ... }

@Entity
@DiscriminatorValue('A')
class Author { ... }
----

We don't need to explicitly specify `@Inheritance(strategy=SINGLE_TABLE)`, since that's the default.

// [[multiple-table-inheritance]]
// === Multiple table inheritance

For `JOINED` inheritance we don't need a discriminator:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy=JOINED)
class Person { ... }

@Entity
class Author { ... }
----

[TIP]
// .Discriminator columns for `JOINED` inheritance
====
However, we can add a discriminator column if we like, and in that case the generated SQL for polymorphic queries will be slightly simpler.
====

Similarly, for `TABLE_PER_CLASS` inheritance we have:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy=TABLE_PER_CLASS)
class Person { ... }

@Entity
class Author { ... }
----

[NOTE]
// .Discriminator columns for `TABLE_PER_CLASS` inheritance
====
Hibernate doesn't allow discriminator columns for `TABLE_PER_CLASS` inheritance mappings, since they would make no sense, and offer no advantage.
====

Notice that in this last case, a polymorphic association like:

[source,java]
----
@ManyToOne Person person;
----

is a bad idea, since it's impossible to create a foreign key constraint that targets both mapped tables.

// [[mixing-inheritance]]
// === Mixed inheritance
//
// Hibernate doesn't support mixing ``InheritanceType``s within a single entity hierarchy.
// However, it's possible to emulate a mix of `SINGLE_TABLE` and `JOINED` inheritance using the `@SecondaryTable` annotation.

[CAUTION]
====
It's quite easy to overuse inheritance.
We've occasionally seen extreme cases where a `JOINED` inheritance hierarchy includes _hundreds_ of entities, spanning hundreds of tables.
Efficiently querying such a hierarchy is an almost impossible task for Hibernate.
Fortunately, a `JOINED` inheritance relationship can always be remodeled as a <<one-to-one-pk,one-to-one association>>, allowing much more efficient queries.
In general, a single entity inheritance hierarchy should never span more than a few tables, including secondary tables.
====

[[table-mappings]]
=== Mapping to tables

The following annotations specify exactly how elements of the domain model map to tables of the relational model:

.Annotations for mapping tables
[%breakable,cols="25,~"]
|===
| Annotation | Purpose

| `@Table` | Map an entity class to its primary table
| `@SecondaryTable` | Define a secondary table for an entity class
| `@JoinTable` | Map a many-to-many or many-to-one association to its association table
| `@CollectionTable` | Map an `@ElementCollection` to its table
|===

The first two annotations are used to map an entity to its _primary table_ and, optionally, one or more _secondary tables_.

[[entity-table-mappings]]
=== Mapping entities to tables

By default, an entity maps to a single table, which may be specified using `@Table`:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="People")
class Person { ... }
----

However, the `@SecondaryTable` annotation allows us to spread its attributes across multiple _secondary tables_.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="Books")
@SecondaryTable(name="Editions")
class Book { ... }
----

The `@Table` annotation can do more than just specify a name:

.`@Table` annotation members
[%breakable,cols="20,~"]
|===
| Annotation member | Purpose

| `name` | The name of the mapped table
| `schema` üíÄ | The schema to which the table belongs
| `catalog` üíÄ | The catalog to which the table belongs
| `uniqueConstraints` | One or more `@UniqueConstraint` annotations declaring multi-column unique constraints
| `indexes` | One or more `@Index` annotations each declaring an index
| `check` | One or more `@CheckConstraint` annotations declaring multi-column check constraints
| `comment` | A DDL comment
|===

[%unbreakable]
[TIP]
// .If you don't need to, don't hardcode the schema and catalog
====
It only makes sense to explicitly specify the `schema` in annotations if the domain model is spread across multiple schemas.

Otherwise, it's a bad idea to hardcode the schema (or catalog) in a `@Table` annotation.
Instead:

- set the configuration property `hibernate.default_schema` (or `hibernate.default_catalog`), or
- simply specify the schema in the JDBC connection URL.
====

The `@SecondaryTable` annotation is even more interesting:

.`@SecondaryTable` annotation members
[%breakable,cols="20,~"]
|===
| Annotation member | Purpose

| `name` | The name of the mapped table
| `schema` üíÄ | The schema to which the table belongs
| `catalog` üíÄ | The catalog to which the table belongs
| `uniqueConstraints` | One or more `@UniqueConstraint` annotations declaring multi-column unique constraints
| `indexes` | One or more `@Index` annotations each declaring an index
| `pkJoinColumns` | One or more `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn` annotations, specifying <<primary-key-column-mappings,primary key column mappings>>
| `foreignKey` | A `@ForeignKey` annotation specifying the name of the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint on the ``@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn``s
| `check` | One or more `@CheckConstraint` annotations declaring multi-column check constraints
| `comment` | A DDL comment
|===

[TIP]
====
Using `@SecondaryTable` on a subclass in a `SINGLE_TABLE` entity inheritance hierarchy gives us a sort of mix of `SINGLE_TABLE` with `JOINED` inheritance.
====

[[join-table-mappings]]
=== Mapping associations to tables

The `@JoinTable` annotation specifies an _association table_, that is, a table holding foreign keys of both associated entities.
This annotation is usually used with `@ManyToMany` associations:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Book {
    ...

    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(name="BooksAuthors")
    Set<Author> authors;

    ...
}
----

But it's even possible to use it to map a `@ManyToOne` or `@OneToOne` association to an association table.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Book {
    ...

    @ManyToOne(fetch=LAZY)
    @JoinTable(name="BookPublisher")
    Publisher publisher;

    ...
}
----

Here, there should be a `UNIQUE` constraint on one of the columns of the association table.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Author {
    ...

    @OneToOne(optional=false, fetch=LAZY)
    @JoinTable(name="AuthorPerson")
    Person author;

    ...
}
----

Here, there should be a `UNIQUE` constraint on _both_ columns of the association table.

.`@JoinTable` annotation members
[%breakable,cols="20,~"]
|===
| Annotation member | Purpose

| `name` | The name of the mapped association table
| `schema` üíÄ | The schema to which the table belongs
| `catalog` üíÄ | The catalog to which the table belongs
| `uniqueConstraints` | One or more `@UniqueConstraint` annotations declaring multi-column unique constraints
| `indexes` | One or more `@Index` annotations each declaring an index
| `joinColumns` | One or more `@JoinColumn` annotations, specifying <<join-column-mappings,foreign key column mappings>> to the table of the owning side
| `inverseJoinColumns` | One or more `@JoinColumn` annotations, specifying <<join-column-mappings,foreign key column mappings>> to the table of the unowned side
| `foreignKey` | A `@ForeignKey` annotation specifying the name of the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint on the ``joinColumns``s
| `inverseForeignKey` | A `@ForeignKey` annotation specifying the name of the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint on the ``inverseJoinColumns``s
| `check` | One or more `@CheckConstraint` annotations declaring multi-column check constraints
| `comment` | A DDL comment
|===

To better understand these annotations, we must first discuss column mappings in general.

[[column-mappings]]
=== Mapping to columns

These annotations specify how elements of the domain model map to columns of tables in the relational model:

.Annotations for mapping columns
[%breakable,cols="25,~"]
|===
| Annotation | Purpose

| `@Column` | Map an attribute to a column
| `@JoinColumn` | Map an association to a foreign key column
| `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn` | Map the primary key used to join a secondary table with its primary, or a subclass table in `JOINED` inheritance with its root class table
| `@OrderColumn` | Specifies a column that should be used to maintain the order of a `List`.
| `@MapKeyColumn` | Specified a column that should be used to persist the keys of a `Map`.
|===

We'll come back to the last two annotations much later, in <<ordered-sorted>>.

We use the `@Column` annotation to map basic attributes.

[[regular-column-mappings]]
=== Mapping basic attributes to columns

The `@Column` annotation is not only useful for specifying the column name.

.`@Column` annotation members
[%breakable,cols="20,~"]
|===
| Annotation member | Purpose

| `name` | The name of the mapped column
| `table` | The name of the table to which this column belongs
| `length` | The length of a `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`, or `VARBINARY` column type
| `precision` | The decimal digits of precision of a `FLOAT`, `DECIMAL`, or `NUMERIC` type
| `scale` | The scale of a `DECIMAL` or `NUMERIC` column type, the digits of precision that occur to the right of the decimal point
| `secondPrecision` | The digits of precision occurring to the right of the decimal point in the seconds field of a `TIME`, or `TIMESTAMP` column type
| `unique` | Whether the column has a `UNIQUE` constraint
| `nullable` | Whether the column has a `NOT NULL` constraint
| `insertable` | Whether the column should appear in generated SQL `INSERT` statements
| `updatable` | Whether the column should appear in generated SQL `UPDATE` statements
| `columnDefinition` üíÄ| A DDL fragment that should be used to declare the column
| `check` | One or more `@CheckConstraint` annotations declaring single-column check constraints
| `comment` | A DDL comment
|===

[TIP]
// .Use of `columnDefinition` results in unportable DDL
====
We no longer recommend the use of `columnDefinition` since it results in unportable DDL.
Hibernate has much better ways to customize the generated DDL using techniques that result in portable behavior across different databases.
====

Here we see four different ways to use the `@Column` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="Books")
@SecondaryTable(name="Editions")
class Book {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name="bookId") // customize column name
    Long id;

    @Column(length=100, nullable=false) // declare column as VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
    String title;
    
    @Column(length=17, unique=true, nullable=false) // declare column as VARCHAR(17) NOT NULL UNIQUE
    String isbn;
    
    @Column(table="Editions", updatable=false) // column belongs to the secondary table, and is never updated
    int edition;
}
----

We don't use `@Column` to map associations.

[[join-column-mappings]]
=== Mapping associations to foreign key columns

The `@JoinColumn` annotation is used to customize a foreign key column.

.`@JoinColumn` annotation members
[%breakable,cols="20,~"]
|===
| Annotation member | Purpose

| `name` | The name of the mapped foreign key column
| `table` | The name of the table to which this column belongs
| `referencedColumnName` | The name of the column to which the mapped foreign key column refers
| `unique` | Whether the column has a `UNIQUE` constraint
| `nullable` | Whether the column has a `NOT NULL` constraint
| `insertable` | Whether the column should appear in generated SQL `INSERT` statements
| `updatable` | Whether the column should appear in generated SQL `UPDATE` statements
| `columnDefinition` üíÄ| A DDL fragment that should be used to declare the column
| `foreignKey` | A `@ForeignKey` annotation specifying the name of the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint
| `check` | One or more `@CheckConstraint` annotations declaring single-column check constraints
| `comment` | A DDL comment
|===

A foreign key column doesn't necessarily have to refer to the primary key of the referenced table.
It's quite acceptable for the foreign key to refer to any other unique key of the referenced entity, even to a unique key of a secondary table.

Here we see how to use `@JoinColumn` to define a `@ManyToOne` association mapping a foreign key column which refers to the `@NaturalId` of `Book`:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="Items")
class Item {
    ...

    @ManyToOne(optional=false)  // implies nullable=false
    @JoinColumn(name = "bookIsbn", referencedColumnName = "isbn",  // a reference to a non-PK column
                foreignKey = @ForeignKey(name="ItemsToBooksBySsn")) // supply a name for the FK constraint
    Book book;

    ...
}
----

In case this is confusing:

- `bookIsbn` is the name of the foreign key column in the `Items` table,
- it refers to a unique key `isbn` in the `Books` table, and
- it has a foreign key constraint named `ItemsToBooksBySsn`.

Note that the `foreignKey` member is completely optional and only affects DDL generation.

[TIP]
// .Foreign key constraint names
====
If you don't supply an explicit name using `@ForeignKey`, Hibernate will generate a quite ugly name.
The reason for this is that the maximum length of foreign key names on some databases is extremely constrained, and we need to avoid collisions.
To be fair, this is perfectly fine if you're only using the generated DDL for testing.
You can customize the generated constraint names by writing your own <<naming-strategies,`ImplicitNamingStrategy`>>.
====

For composite foreign keys we might have multiple `@JoinColumn` annotations:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="Items")
class Item {
    ...

    @ManyToOne(optional=false)
    @JoinColumn(name = "bookIsbn", referencedColumnName = "isbn")
    @JoinColumn(name = "bookPrinting", referencedColumnName = "printing")
    Book book;

    ...
}
----

If we need to specify the `@ForeignKey`, this starts to get a bit messy:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="Items")
class Item {
    ...

    @ManyToOne(optional=false)
    @JoinColumns(value = {@JoinColumn(name = "bookIsbn", referencedColumnName = "isbn"),
                          @JoinColumn(name = "bookPrinting", referencedColumnName = "printing")},
                 foreignKey = @ForeignKey(name="ItemsToBooksBySsn"))
    Book book;

    ...
}
----

For associations mapped to a `@JoinTable`, fetching the association requires two joins, and so we must declare the ``@JoinColumn``s inside the `@JoinTable` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Book {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    Long id;

    @ManyToMany
    @JoinTable(joinColumns=@JoinColumn(name="bookId"),
               inverseJoinColumns=@joinColumn(name="authorId"),
               foreignKey=@ForeignKey(name="BooksToAuthors"))
    Set<Author> authors;

    ...
}
----

Again, the `foreignKey` member is optional.

[TIP]
====
For mapping a `@OneToOne` association <<one-to-one-pk,to a primary key>> with `@MapsId`, Hibernate lets us use either `@JoinColumn` or `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn`.
[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Author {
    @Id
    Long id;

    @OneToOne(optional=false, fetch=LAZY)
    @MapsId
    @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="personId")
    Person author;

    ...
}
----
Arguably, the use of `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn` is clearer.
====

[[primary-key-column-mappings]]
=== Mapping primary key joins between tables

The `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn` is a special-purpose annotation for mapping:

- the primary key column of a `@SecondaryTable`‚Äîwhich is also a foreign key referencing the primary table, or
- the primary key column of the primary table mapped by a subclass in a `JOINED` inheritance hierarchy‚Äîwhich is also a foreign key referencing the primary table mapped by the root entity.

.`@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn` annotation members
[%breakable,cols="20,~"]
|===
| Annotation member | Purpose

| `name` | The name of the mapped foreign key column
| `referencedColumnName` | The name of the column to which the mapped foreign key column refers
| `columnDefinition` üíÄ| A DDL fragment that should be used to declare the column
| `foreignKey` | A `@ForeignKey` annotation specifying the name of the `FOREIGN KEY` constraint
|===

When mapping a subclass table primary key, we place the `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn` annotation on the entity class:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="People")
@Inheritance(strategy=JOINED)
class Person { ... }

@Entity
@Table(name="Authors")
@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="personId") // the primary key of the Authors table
class Author { ... }
----

But to map a secondary table primary key, the `@PrimaryKeyJoinColumn` annotation must occur inside the `@SecondaryTable` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(name="Books")
@SecondaryTable(name="Editions",
                pkJoinColumns = @PrimaryKeyJoinColumn(name="bookId")) // the primary key of the Editions table
class Book {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    @Column(name="bookId") // the name of the primary key of the Books table
    Long id;

    ...
}
----

[[column-lengths]]
=== Column lengths and adaptive column types

Hibernate automatically adjusts the column type used in generated DDL based on the column length specified by the `@Column` annotation.
So we don't usually need to explicitly specify that a column should be of type `TEXT` or `CLOB`‚Äîor worry about the parade of `TINYTEXT`, `MEDIUMTEXT`, `TEXT`, `LONGTEXT` types on MySQL‚Äîbecause Hibernate automatically selects one of those types if required to accommodate a string of the `length` we specify.

The constant values defined in the class link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/Length.html[`Length`] are very helpful here:

.Predefined column lengths
[%breakable,cols="10,12,~"]
|===
| Constant | Value | Description

| `DEFAULT` | 255 | The default length of a `VARCHAR` or `VARBINARY` column when none is explicitly specified
| `LONG` | 32600 | The largest column length for a `VARCHAR` or `VARBINARY` that is allowed on every database Hibernate supports
| `LONG16` | 32767 | The maximum length that can be represented using 16 bits (but this length is too large for a `VARCHAR` or `VARBINARY` column on for some database)
| `LONG32` | 2147483647 | The maximum length for a Java string
|===

We can use these constants in the `@Column` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Column(length=LONG)
String text;

@Column(length=LONG32)
byte[] binaryData;
----

This is usually all you need to do to make use of large object types in Hibernate.

[[lobs]]
=== LOBs

JPA provides a `@Lob` annotation which specifies that a field should be persisted as a `BLOB` or `CLOB`.

.Semantics of the `@Lob` annotation
****
What the spec actually says is that the field should be persisted

> ...as a large object to a database-supported large object type.

It's quite unclear what this means, and the spec goes on to say that

> ...the treatment of the `Lob` annotation is provider-dependent...

which doesn't help much.
****

Hibernate interprets this annotation in what we think is the most reasonable way.
In Hibernate, an attribute annotated `@Lob` will be written to JDBC using the `setClob()` or `setBlob()` method of `PreparedStatement`, and will be read from JDBC using the `getClob()` or `getBlob()` method of `ResultSet`.

Now, the use of these JDBC methods is usually unnecessary!
JDBC drivers are perfectly capable of converting between `String` and `CLOB` or between `byte[]` and `BLOB`.
So unless you specifically need to use these JDBC LOB APIs, you _don't_ need the `@Lob` annotation.

Instead, as we just saw in <<column-lengths>>, all you need is to specify a large enough column `length` to accommodate the data you plan to write to that column.

You should usually write this:
[source,java]
----
@Column(length=LONG32) // good, correct column type inferred
String text;
----
instead of this:
[source,java]
----
@Lob // almost always unnecessary
String text;
----

This is particularly true for PostgreSQL.

[%unbreakable]
[WARNING]
// .PostgreSQL `BYTEA` and `TEXT`
====
Unfortunately, the driver for PostgreSQL doesn't allow `BYTEA` or `TEXT` columns to be read via the JDBC LOB APIs.

This limitation of the Postgres driver has resulted in a whole cottage industry of bloggers and stackoverflow question-answerers recommending convoluted ways to hack the Hibernate `Dialect` for Postgres to allow an attribute annotated `@Lob` to be written using `setString()` and read using `getString()`.

But simply removing the `@Lob` annotation has exactly the same effect.

Conclusion:

- on PostgreSQL, `@Lob` always means the `OID` type,
- `@Lob` should never be used to map columns of type `BYTEA` or `TEXT`, and
- please don't believe everything you read on stackoverflow.
====

Finally, as an alternative, Hibernate lets you declare an attribute of type `java.sql.Blob` or `java.sql.Clob`.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Book {
    ...
    Clob text;
    Blob coverArt;
    ....
}
----

The advantage is that a `java.sql.Clob` or `java.sql.Blob` can in principle index up to 2^63^ characters or bytes, much more data than you can fit in a Java `String` or `byte[]` array (or in your computer).

To assign a value to these fields, we'll need to use a link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/LobHelper.html[`LobHelper`].
We can get one from the `Session`:

[source,java]
----
LobHelper helper = session.getLobHelper();
book.text = helper.createClob(text);
book.coverArt = helper.createBlob(image);
----

In principle, the `Blob` and `Clob` objects provide efficient ways to read or stream LOB data from the server.

[source,java]
----
Book book = session.find(Book.class, bookId);
String text = book.text.getSubString(1, textLength);
InputStream bytes = book.coverArt.getBinaryStream();
----

Of course, the behavior here depends very much on the JDBC driver, and so we really can't promise that this is a sensible thing to do on your database.

[[mapping-embeddables]]
=== Mapping embeddable types to UDTs or to JSON

There's a couple of alternative ways to represent an embeddable type on the database side.

[[embeddable-udt]]
[discrete]
==== Embeddables as UDTs

First, a really nice option, at least in the case of Java record types, and for databases which support _user-defined types_ (UDTs), is to define a UDT which represents the record type.
Hibernate 6 makes this really easy.
Just annotate the record type, or the attribute which holds a reference to it, with the new `@Struct` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
@Struct(name="PersonName")
record Name(String firstName, String middleName, String lastName) {}
----
[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Person {
    ...
    Name name;
    ...
}
----

This results in the following UDT:

[source,sql]
----
create type PersonName as (firstName varchar(255), middleName varchar(255), lastName varchar(255))
----

And the `name` column of the `Author` table will have the type `PersonName`.

[discrete]
==== Embeddables to JSON

A second option that's available is to map the embeddable type to a `JSON` (or `JSONB`) column.
Now, this isn't something we would exactly _recommend_ if you're defining a data model from scratch, but it's at least useful for mapping pre-existing tables with JSON-typed columns.
Since embeddable types are nestable, we can map some JSON formats this way, and even query JSON properties using HQL.

[NOTE]
====
At this time, JSON arrays are not supported!
====

To map an attribute of embeddable type to JSON, we must annotate the attribute `@JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON)`, instead of annotating the embeddable type.
But the embeddable type `Name` should still be annotated `@Embeddable` if we want to query its attributes using HQL.

[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
record Name(String firstName, String middleName, String lastName) {}
----
[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Person {
    ...
    @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON)
    Name name;
    ...
}
----

We also need to add Jackson or an implementation of JSONB‚Äîfor example, Yasson‚Äîto our runtime classpath.
To use Jackson we could add this line to our Gradle build:

[source,groovy]
----
runtimeOnly 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:{jacksonVersion}'
----

Now the `name` column of the `Author` table will have the type `jsonb`, and Hibernate will automatically use Jackson to serialize a `Name` to and from JSON format.

[[miscellaneous-mappings]]
=== Summary of SQL column type mappings

So, as we've seen, there are quite a few annotations that affect the mapping of Java types to SQL column types in DDL.
Here we summarize the ones we've just seen in the second half of this chapter, along with some we already mentioned in earlier chapters.

.Annotations for mapping SQL column types
[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
| Annotation | Interpretation

| `@Enumerated`, `@EnumeratedValue` | Specify how an <<enums,`enum` type should be persisted>>
| `@Nationalized` | Use a <<nationalized-chars,nationalized character type>>: `NCHAR`, `NVARCHAR`, or `NCLOB`
| `@Lob` üíÄ | Use <<lobs,JDBC LOB APIs>> to read and write the annotated attribute
| `@Array` | Map a collection to a <<arrays,SQL `ARRAY` type>> of the specified length
| `@Struct` | Map an <<embeddable-udt,embeddable to a SQL UDT>> with the given name
| `@TimeZoneStorage` | Specify how the link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/annotations/TimeZoneStorageType.html[time zone information should be persisted]
| `@JdbcType` or `@JdbcTypeCode` | Use an implementation of <<jdbc-type,`JdbcType`>> to map an arbitrary SQL type
| `@Collate` | Specify a collation for a column
|===

In addition, there are link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/cfg/MappingSettings.html[some configuration properties] which have a _global_ effect on how basic types map to SQL column types:

.Type mapping settings
[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
| Configuration property name | Purpose

| `hibernate.use_nationalized_character_data` | Enable use of <<nationalized-chars,nationalized character types>> by default
| `hibernate.type.preferred_boolean_jdbc_type` | Specify the default SQL column type for storing a `boolean`
| `hibernate.type.preferred_uuid_jdbc_type` | Specify the default SQL column type for storing a `UUID`
| `hibernate.type.preferred_duration_jdbc_type` | Specify the default SQL column type for storing a `Duration`
| `hibernate.type.preferred_instant_jdbc_type` | Specify the default SQL column type for storing an `Instant`
| `hibernate.timezone.default_storage` | Specify the default strategy for link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/annotations/TimeZoneStorageType.html[storing time zone information]
| `hibernate.type.prefer_native_enum_types` | Use <<named-enums,named enum types>> on PostgreSQL and Oracle
|===

Earlier, we saw how to use these settings to control the default mappings for <<datetime-types,`Instant` and `Duration`>>.

[TIP]
====
These are _global_ settings and thus quite clumsy.
We recommend against messing with any of these settings unless you have a really good reason for it.

There's one more topic we would like to cover in this chapter.

[[mapping-formulas]]
=== Mapping to formulas

Hibernate lets us map an attribute of an entity to a SQL formula involving columns of the mapped table.
Thus, the attribute is a sort of "derived" value.

.Annotations for mapping formulas
[%autowidth.stretch]
|===
| Annotation | Purpose

| link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/annotations/Formula.html[`@Formula`] | Map an attribute to a SQL formula
| `@JoinFormula` | Map an association to a SQL formula
| `@DiscriminatorFormula` | Use a SQL formula as the discriminator in <<mapping-inheritance,single table inheritance>>.
|===

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Order {
    ...
    @Column(name = "sub_total", scale=2, precision=8)
    BigDecimal subTotal;

    @Column(name = "tax", scale=4, precision=4)
    BigDecimal taxRate;

    @Formula("sub_total * (1.0 + tax)")
    BigDecimal totalWithTax;
    ...
}
----

The formula is evaluated every time the entity is read from the database.

[[derived-identity]]
=== Derived Identity

An entity has a _derived identity_ if it inherits part of its primary key from an associated "parent" entity.
We've already met a kind of degenerate case of _derived identity_ when we talked about <<one-to-one-pk,one-to-one associations with a shared primary key>>.

But a `@ManyToOne` association may also form part of a derived identity.
That is to say, there could be a foreign key column or columns included as part of the composite primary key.
There's three different ways to represent this situation on the Java side of things:

- using `@IdClass` without `@MapsId`,
- using `@IdClass` with `@MapsId`, or
- using `@EmbeddedId` with `@MapsId`.

Let's suppose we have a `Parent` entity class defined as follows:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Parent {
    @Id
    Long parentId;

    ...
}
----

The `parentId` field holds the primary key of the `Parent` table, which will also form part of the composite primary key of every `Child` belonging to the `Parent`.

[discrete]
==== First way

In the first, slightly simpler approach, we define an `@IdClass` to represent the primary key of `Child`:

[source,java]
----
class DerivedId {
    Long parent;
    String childId;

    // constructors, equals, hashcode, etc
    ...
}
----

And a `Child` entity class with a `@ManyToOne` association annotated `@Id`:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@IdClass(DerivedId.class)
class Child {
    @Id
    String childId;

    @Id @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="parentId")
    Parent parent;

    ...
}
----

Then the primary key of the `Child` table comprises the columns `(childId,parentId)`.

[discrete]
==== Second way

This is fine, but sometimes it's nice to have a field for each element of the primary key.
We may use the `@MapsId` annotation we met <<one-to-one-pk,earlier>>:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@IdClass(DerivedId.class)
class Child {
    @Id
    Long parentId;
    @Id
    String childId;

    @ManyToOne
    @MapsId(Child_.PARENT_ID) // typesafe reference to Child.parentId
    @JoinColumn(name="parentId")
    Parent parent;

    ...
}
----

We're using the approach we saw <<mapped-by-metamodel,previously>> to refer to the `parentId` property of `Child` in a typesafe way.

Note that we must place column mapping information on the association annotated `@MapsId`, not on the `@Id` field.

We must slightly modify our `@IdClass` so that field names align:

[source,java]
----
class DerivedId {
    Long parentId;
    String childId;

    // constructors, equals, hashcode, etc
    ...
}
----

[discrete]
==== Third way

The third alternative is to redefine our `@IdClass` as an `@Embeddable`.
We don't actually need to change the `DerivedId` class, but we do need to add the annotation.

[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
class DerivedId {
    Long parentId;
    String childId;

    // constructors, equals, hashcode, etc
    ...
}
----

Then we may use `@EmbeddedId` in `Child`:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
class Child {
    @EmbeddedId
    DerivedId id;

    @ManyToOne
    @MapsId(DerivedId_.PARENT_ID) // typesafe reference to DerivedId.parentId
    @JoinColumn(name="parentId")
    Parent parent;

    ...
}
----

The <<composite-identifiers,choice>> between `@IdClass` and `@EmbeddedId` boils down to taste.
The `@EmbeddedId` is perhaps a little DRYer.

[[constraints]]
=== Adding constraints

Database constraints are important.
Even if you're sure that your program has no bugs üßê, it's probably not the only program with access to the database.
Constraints help ensure that different programs (and human administrators) play nicely with each other.

Hibernate adds certain constraints to generated DDL automatically: primary key constraints, foreign key constraints, and some unique constraints.
But it's common to need to:

- add additional unique constraints,
- add check constraints, or
- customize the name of a foreign key constraint.

We've <<join-column-mappings,already seen>> how to use `@ForeignKey` to specify the name of a foreign key constraint.

There are two ways to add a unique constraint to a table:

- using `@Column(unique=true)` to indicate a single-column unique key, or
- using the `@UniqueConstraint` annotation to define a uniqueness constraint on a combination of columns.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Table(uniqueConstraints=@UniqueConstraint(columnNames={"title", "year", "publisher_id"}))
class Book { ... }
----

This annotation looks a bit ugly perhaps, but it's actually useful even as documentation.

The `@Check` annotation adds a check constraint to the table.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@Check(name="ValidISBN", constraints="length(isbn)=13")
class Book { ... }
----

The `@Check` annotation is commonly used at the field level:

[source,java]
----
@Id @Check(constraints="length(isbn)=13")
String isbn;
----
