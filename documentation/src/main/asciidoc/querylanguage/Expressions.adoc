[[expressions]]
== Expressions

We now switch gears, and begin describing the language from the bottom up.
The very bottom of a programming language is its syntax for literal values.

// Essentially, expressions are references that resolve to basic or tuple values.

[[literals]]
=== Literals

The most important literal value in this language is `null`. It's assignable to any other type.

[[boolean-literals]]
==== Boolean literals

The boolean literal values are the (case-insensitive) keywords `true` and `false`.

[[string-literals]]
==== String literals

String literals are enclosed in single quotes.

[source,hql]
----
select 'hello world'
----

To escape a single quote within a string literal, use a doubled single quote: `''`.

[[string-literals-example]]
//.String literals examples
[source, hql]
----
from Book where title like 'Ender''s'
----

Alternatively, Java-style double-quoted strings are also allowed, with the usual Java character escape syntax.

[source,hql]
----
select "hello\tworld"
----

This option is not much used.

[[numeric-literals]]
==== Numeric literals

Numeric literals come in several different forms:

|===
| Kind | Type | Example

| Integer literals | `Long`, `Integer`, `BigInteger` | `1`, `3_000_000L`, `2BI`
| Decimal literals | `Double`, `Float`, `BigDecimal` | `1.0`, `123.456F`, `3.14159265BD`
| Hexadecimal literals | `Long`, `Integer` | `0X1A2B`, `0x1a2b`
| Scientific notation | `Double`, `Float`, `BigDecimal` | `1e-6`, `6.674E-11F`
|===

For example:

[[numeric-literals-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book where price < 100.0
----
[source, hql]
----
select author, count(book)
from Author as author
    join author.books as book
group by author
having count(book) > 10
----

The type of a numeric literal may be specified using a Java-style postfix:
|===
| Postfix | Type | Java type

| `L` or `l` | long integer | `long`
| `D` or `d` | double precision | `double`
| `F` or `f` | single precision | `float`
| `BI` or `bi` | large integer | `BigInteger`
| `BD` or `bd` | exact decimal | `BigDecimal`
|===

It's not usually necessary to specify the precision explicitly.

[NOTE]
====
In a literal with an exponent, the `E` is case-insensitive.
Similarly, the Java-style postfix is case-insensitive.
====

[[datetime-literals]]
==== Date and time literals

According to the JPQL specification, literal dates and times may be specified using the JDBC escape syntax.

[cols="~,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Date/time type | Java type | JDBC escape syntax | JPA standard

| Date | `java.sql.Date` ðŸ’€ | `{d 'yyyy-mm-dd'}` | âœ”
| Time | `java.sql.Time` ðŸ’€ | `{t 'hh:mm'}` | âœ”
| Time with seconds | `java.sql.Time` ðŸ’€ | `{t 'hh:mm:ss'}` | âœ”
| Timestamp | `java.sql.Timestamp` ðŸ’€ | `{ts 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss'}` | âœ”
| Timestamp with milliseconds | `java.sql.Timestamp` ðŸ’€ | `{ts 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss.millis'}` | âœ”
| Timestamp with an offset | `java.sql.Timestamp` ðŸ’€ | `{ts 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss+hh:mm'}` | âœ”
| Timestamp with a time zone | `java.sql.Timestamp` ðŸ’€ | `{ts 'yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ss GMT'}` | âœ”
|===

There's two problems here:

1. this syntax is rather unpleasant to look at, and
2. these literals are assigned types defined by JDBC, instead of date/time types defined in `java.time`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The use of date and time types from the `java.sql` package is strongly discouraged!
Jakarta Persistence 3.2 deprecates support for these types.
Always use `java.time` types in new code.
====

HQL provides not one, but two alternatives.

[cols="~,~,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Date/time type | Java type| Braced literal syntax | Explicitly-typed literal syntax | JPA standard

| Date | `LocalDate` | `{yyyy-mm-dd}` | `date yyyy-mm-dd` | âœ–
| Time | `LocalTime` | `{hh:mm}` | `time hh:mm` | âœ–
| Time with seconds | `LocalTime` | `{hh:mm:ss}` | `time hh:mm:ss` | âœ–
| Datetime | `LocalDateTime` | `{yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss}` | `datetime yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss` | âœ–
| Datetime with milliseconds | `LocalDateTime` | `{yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.millis}` | `datetime yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.millis` | âœ–
| Datetime with an offset | `OffsetDateTime` | `{yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss +hh:mm}` | `datetime yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss +hh:mm` | âœ–
| Datetime with a time zone | `OffsetDateTime` | `{yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss GMT}` | `datetime yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss GMT` | âœ–
|===

Literals referring to the current date and time are also available.

[cols="~,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Date/time type | Java type | Syntax | JPA standard

| Date | `java.time.LocalDate` | `local date` | âœ”
| Time | `java.time.LocalTime` | `local time` | âœ”
| Datetime | `java.time.LocalDateTime` | `local datetime` | âœ”
| Offset datetime | `java.time.OffsetDateTime` | `offset datetime` | âœ–
| Instant | `java.time.Instant` | `instant` | âœ–
|===

The following are deprecated in JPA 3.2.
We include them here only for completeness:

[cols="~,~,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Date/time type | Java type | JPA syntax âœ” | HQL syntax âœ– | JPA standard

| JDBC date | `java.sql.Date` ðŸ’€| `current_date` | `current date` | ðŸ’€
| JDBC time | `java.sql.Time` ðŸ’€| `current_time` | `current time` | ðŸ’€
| JDBC timestamp | `java.sql.Timestamp` ðŸ’€| `current_timestamp` | `current timestamp` | ðŸ’€
|===

[[duration-literals]]
==== Duration literals

There are two sorts of duration in HQL:

* _year-day durations_, that is, the length of an interval between two dates, and
* _week-nanosecond durations_, that is, the length of an interval between two datetimes.

For conceptual reasons, the two kinds of duration cannot be cleanly composed.

Literal duration expressions are of form `n unit`, for example `1 day` or `10 year` or `100 nanosecond`.

[source, hql]
----
select start, end, start - 30 minute from Event
----

The unit may be: `day`, `week`, `month`, `quarter`, `year`, `second`, `minute`, `hour`, or `nanosecond`.

[NOTE]
====
A HQL duration is considered to map to a Java `java.time.Duration`, but semantically they're perhaps more similar to an ANSI SQL `INTERVAL` type.
====

[[binary-literals]]
==== Binary string literals

HQL also provides a choice of formats for binary strings:

* the braced syntax `{0xDE, 0xAD, 0xBE, 0xEF}`, a list of Java-style hexadecimal byte literals, or
* the quoted syntax `X'DEADBEEF'` or `x'deadbeef'`, similar to SQL.

[[enum-literals]]
==== Enum literals

Literal values of a Java enumerated type may be written without needing to specify the enum class name:

[[enum-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book where status <> OUT_OF_PRINT
----
[source, hql]
----
from Book where type in (BOOK, MAGAZINE)
----
[source, hql]
----
update Book set status = OUT_OF_PRINT
----

In the examples above, the enum class is inferred from the type of the expression on the left of the comparison, assignment operator, or
`in` predicate.

[[enum-case-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book
order by
    case type
    when BOOK then 1
    when MAGAZINE then 2
    when JOURNAL then 3
    else 4
    end
----

In this example the enum class is inferred from the type of the `case` expression.

[[java-constants]]
==== Java constants

HQL allows any Java `static` constant to be used in HQL, but it must be referenced by its fully-qualified name:

[[java-constant-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select java.lang.Math.PI
----

[[entity-name-literals]]
==== Literal entity names

Entity names may also occur as a literal value. They do not need to be qualified.

[source,hql]
----
from Payment as payment
where type(payment) = CreditCardPayment
----

See <<functions-typecasts>>.

[[path-expressions]]
=== Identification variables and path expressions

A path expression is either:

- a reference to an <<identification-variables,identification variable>>, or
- a _compound path_, beginning with a reference to an identification variable, and followed by a period-separated list of references to entity attributes.

As an extension to the JPA spec, HQL, just like SQL, allows a compound path expression where the identification variable at the beginning of the path is missing.
That is, instead of `var.foo.bar`, it's legal to write just `foo.bar`.
But this is only allowed when the identification variable may be unambiguously inferred from the first element, `foo` of the compound path.
The query must have exactly one identification variable `var` for which the path `var.foo` refers to an entity attribute.
Note that we will continue to call these paths "compound", even if they only have one element.

[TIP]
====
This streamlines the query rather nicely when there's just one root entity and no joins.
But when the query has multiple identification variables it makes the query much harder to understand.
====

If an element of a compound path refers to an association, the path expression produces an <<implicit-join,implicit join>>.

[source,hql]
----
select book.publisher.name from Book book
----

An element of a compound path referring to a many-to-one or on-to-one association may have the <<function-treat,treat>> function applied to it.

[source,hql]
----
select treat(order.payment as CreditCardPayment).cardNumber from Order order
----

If an element of a compound path refers to a collection or many-valued association, it must have one of <<collection-functions,these special functions>> applied to it.

[source,hql]
----
select element(book.authors).name from Book book
----

No other function may be applied to a non-terminal element of a path expression.

Alternatively, if the element of the compound path refers to a list or map, it may have the indexing operator applied to it:

[source,hql]
----
select book.editions[0].date from Book book
----

No other operator may be applied to a non-terminal element of a path expression.

=== Operator expressions

HQL has operators for working with strings, numeric values, and date/time types.

The operator precedence is given by this table, from highest to lowest precedence:

[cols="40,^20,~"]
|===
| Precedence class | Type | Operators

| Grouping and tuple instantiation | | `( ... )` and `(x, y, z)`
| Case lists |  | `case ... end`
| Member reference | Binary infix | `a.b`
| Function application | Postfix | `f(x,y)`
| Indexing | Postfix | `a[i]`
| Unary numeric | Unary prefix | `+`, `-`
| Duration conversions | Unary postfix | `by day` and friends
| Binary multiplicative | Binary infix | `*`, `/`, `%`
| Binary additive | Binary infix | `+`, `-`
| Concatenation | Binary infix | `\|\|`
| Nullness, emptiness, truth | Unary postfix | `is null`, `is empty`, `is true`, `is false`
| Containment | Binary infix | `in`, `not in`
| Between | Ternary infix | `between`, `not between`
| Pattern matching | Binary infix | `like`, `ilike`, `not like`, `not ilike`
| Comparison operators | Binary infix | `=`, `<>`, `<`, `>`, `\<=`, `>=`
| Nullsafe comparison | Binary infix | `is distinct from`, `is not distinct from`
| Existence | Unary prefix | `exists`
| Membership | Binary infix | `member of`, `not member of`
| Logical negation | Unary prefix | `not`
| Logical conjunction | Binary infix | `and`
| Logical disjunction | Binary infix | `or`
|===

[[concatenation]]
==== String concatenation

JPQL defines two ways to concatenate strings:

* the SQL-style concatenation operator, `||`, and
* the standard `concat()` function.

See <<string-functions, below>> for details of the `concat()` function.

[[concatenation-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select book.title || ' by ' || listagg(author.name, ' & ')
from Book as book
    join book.authors as author
group by book
----

Many more operations on strings are defined below, in <<exp-functions>>.

[[numeric-arithmetic]]
==== Numeric arithmetic

The basic SQL arithmetic operators, `+`,`-`,`*`, and `/` are joined by the remainder operator `%`.

[[numeric-arithmetic-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select (1.0 + :taxRate) * sum(item.book.price * item.quantity)
from Order as ord
    join ord.items as item
where ord.id = :oid
----

When both operands of a binary numeric operator have the same type, the result type of the whole expression is the same as the operands.

[WARNING]
====
By default, the semantics of integer division depend on the database:

- On most databases, division of an integer by an integer evaluates to an integer, just like in Java.
  Thus, `3/2` evaluates to `1`.
- But on some databases, including Oracle, MySQL, and MariaDB, integer division may result in a non-integral value.
  So `3/2` evaluates to `1.5` on these databases.

This default behavior may be changed using configuration property `hibernate.query.hql.portable_integer_division`.
Setting this property to `true` instructs Hibernate to produce SQL that emulates Java-style integer division (that is, `3/2 = 1`) on platforms where that is not the native semantics.
====

When the operands are of different types, one of the operands is implicitly converted to _wider_ type, with wideness given, in decreasing order, by the list below:

- `Double` (widest)
- `Float`
- `BigDecimal`
- `BigInteger`
- `Long`
- `Integer`
- `Short`
- `Byte`

Many more numeric operations are defined below, in <<exp-functions>>.

[[Datetime-arithmetic]]
==== Datetime arithmetic

Arithmetic involving dates, datetimes, and durations is quite subtle.
Among the issues to consider are:

- There are two kinds of duration: year-day, and week-nanosecond durations.
The first is a difference between dates; the second is a difference between datetimes.
- We can subtract dates and datetimes, but we can't add them.
- A Java-style duration has much too much precision, and so in order to use it for anything useful, we must somehow truncate it to something coarser-grained.

Here we list the basic operations.

[cols="10,38,~,18"]
|===
| Operator | Expression type | Example | Resulting type

| `-` | Difference between two dates | `your.birthday - local date` | year-day duration
| `-` | Difference between two datetimes | `local datetime - record.lastUpdated` | week-nanosecond duration
| `-` | Difference of a date and a year-day duration | `local date - 1 day` | date
| `-` | Difference of a datetime and a week-nanosecond duration | `record.lastUpdated - 1 minute` | datetime
| `-` | Difference between two durations | `1 week - 1 day` | duration
| `+` | Sum of a date and a year-day duration | `local date + 1 week` | date
| `+` | Sum of a datetime and a week-nanosecond duration | `record.lastUpdated + 1 second` | datetime
| `+` | Sum of two durations | `1 day + 4 hour` | duration
| `*` | Product of an integer and a duration | `billing.cycles * 30 day` | duration
| `by unit` | Convert a duration to an integer | `(1 year) by day` | integer
|===

The `by unit` operator converts a duration to an integer, for example: `(local date - your.birthday) by day` evaluates to the number of days you still have to wait.

The function `extract(unit from ...)` extracts a field from a date, time, or datetime type, for example, `extract(year from your.birthday)` produces the year in which you were born, and throws away important information about your birthday.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Please carefully note the difference between these two operations: `by` and `extract()` both evaluate to an integer, but they have very different uses.
====

Additional datetime operations, including the useful `format()` function, are defined below, in <<exp-functions>>.

[[case-expressions]]
=== Case expressions

Just like in standard SQL, there are two forms of case expression:

* the _simple_ case expression, and
* the so-called _searched_ case expression.

[TIP]
====
Case expressions are verbose.
It's often simpler to use the `coalesce()`, `nullif()`, or `ifnull()` functions,
as described below in <<functions-null>>.
====

[[simple-case-expressions]]
[discrete]
===== Simple case expressions

The syntax of the simple form is defined by:

[[simple-case-expressions-bnf]]
[source, antlrv4]
----
include::{extrasdir}/simple_case_bnf.txt[]
----

For example:

[[simple-case-expressions-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select
    case author.nomDePlume
        when '' then person.name
        else author.nomDePlume end
from Author as author
    join author.person as person
----

[[searched-case-expressions]]
[discrete]
===== Searched case expressions

The searched form has the following syntax:

[[searched-case-expressions-bnf]]
[source, antlrv4]
----
include::{extrasdir}/searched_case_bnf.txt[]
----

For example:

[[searched-case-expressions-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select
    case
        when author.nomDePlume is null then person.name
        else author.nomDePlume end
from Author as author
    join author.person as person
----

A `case` expression may contain complex expression, including operator expressions.

[[tuple-instantiation]]
=== Tuples

A _tuple instantiation_ is an expression like `(1, 'hello')`, and may be used to "vectorize" comparison expressions.

[[tuple-comparison]]
[source,hql]
----
from Person where (firstName, lastName) = ('Ludwig', 'Boltzmann')
----
[source,hql]
----
from Event where (year, day) > (year(local date), day(local date))
----

This syntax may be used even when the underlying SQL dialect does _not_ support so-called "row value" constructors.

A tuple value may be compared to an embedded field:

[[tuple-embeddable]]
[source,hql]
----
from Person
where address = ('1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW', 'Washington', 'DC', 20500, 'USA')
----

[[exp-functions]]
=== Functions

Both HQL and JPQL define some standard functions and make them portable between databases.

[%unbreakable]
[TIP]
====
A program that wishes to remain portable between Jakarta Persistence providers should in principle limit itself to the use of the functions which are blessed by the specification.
Unfortunately, there's not so many of them.
====

In some cases, the syntax of these functions looks a bit funny at first, for example, `cast(number as String)`, or `extract(year from date)`, or even `trim(leading '.' from string)`.
This syntax is inspired by standard ANSI SQL, and we promise you'll get used to it.

[%unbreakable]
[IMPORTANT]
====
HQL abstracts away from the actual database-native SQL functions, letting you write queries which are portable between databases.

For some functions, and always depending on the database, a HQL function invocation translates to a quite complicated SQL expression!
====

In addition, there are several ways to use a database function that's not known to Hibernate.

[[functions-typecasts]]
==== Types and typecasts

The following special functions make it possible to discover or narrow expression types:

[cols="15,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Special function | Purpose | Signature | JPA standard

| `type()` | The (concrete) entity or embeddable type | `type(e)` | âœ”
| `treat()` | Narrow an entity or embeddable type | `treat(e as Entity)` | âœ”
| `cast()` | Narrow a basic type | `cast(x as Type)` | âœ”
| `str()` | Cast to a string | `str(x)` | âœ–
| `ordinal()` | Get the ordinal value of an enum | `ordinal(x)` | âœ–
| `string()` | Get the string-valued name of an enum | `string(x)` | âœ–
|===

Let's see what these functions do.

[[function-type]]
[discrete]
===== Evaluating an entity type

The function `type()`, applied to an identification variable or to an entity-valued or embeddable-valued path expression, evaluates to the concrete type, that is, the Java `Class`, of the referenced entity or embeddable.
This is mainly useful when dealing with entity inheritance hierarchies.

[[entity-type-exp-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select payment
from Payment as payment
where type(payment) = CreditCardPayment
----

[[function-treat]]
[discrete]
===== Narrowing an entity type

The function `treat()` may be used to narrow the type of an identification variable.
This is useful when dealing with entity or embeddable inheritance hierarchies.

[[treat-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select payment
from Payment as payment
where length(treat(payment as CreditCardPayment).cardNumber)
        between 16 and 20
----

The type of the expression `treat(p as CreditCardPayment)` is the narrowed type, `CreditCardPayment`, instead of the declared type `Payment` of `p`.
This allows the attribute `cardNumber` declared by the subtype `CreditCardPayment` to be referenced.

- The first argument is usually an identification variable.
- The second argument is the target type given as an unqualified entity name.

The `treat()` function may even occur in a <<join-treat,join>>.

[[function-cast]]
[discrete]
===== General typecasts

The function `cast()` has a similar syntax, but is used to narrow basic types.

- Its first argument is usually an attribute of an entity, or a more complex expression involving entity attributes.
- Its second argument is the target type given as an unqualified Java class name:
`String`, `Long`, `Integer`, `Double`, `Float`, `Character`, `Byte`, `BigInteger`, `BigDecimal`, `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, `LocalDateTime`, etc.

[source, hql]
----
select cast(id as String) from Order
----

[[function-str]]
[discrete]
===== Casting to string

The function `str(x)` is a synonym for `cast(x as String)`.

[source, hql]
----
select str(id) from Order
----

[[function-ordinal]]
[discrete]
===== Extracting the ordinal value or name of an enum

The function `ordinal(x)` extracts the ordinal value of an enum, and the function `string(x)` extracts the name of the enum value as a string.

[source, hql]
----
select ordinal(p.type), string(p.type) from Phone p
----

Both functions work with enum fields mapped as `ORDINAL` and with enum fields mapped as `STRING`.

[[functions-null]]
==== Functions for working with null values

The following functions make it easy to deal with null values:

[cols="15,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Function | Purpose | Signature | JPA standard

| `coalesce()` | First non-null argument | `coalesce(x, y, z)` | âœ”
| `ifnull()` | Second argument if first is null | `ifnull(x,y)` | âœ–
| `nullif()` | `null` if arguments are equal | `nullif(x,y)` | âœ”
|===

[discrete]
===== Handling null values

The `coalesce()` function is a sort of abbreviated `case` expression that returns the first non-null operand.

[[coalesce-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select coalesce(author.nomDePlume, person.name)
from Author as author
    join author.person as person
----

[discrete]
===== Handling null values

HQL allows `ifnull()` as a synonym for `coalesce()` in the case of exactly two arguments.

[[ifnull-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select ifnull(author.nomDePlume, person.name)
from Author as author
    join author.person as person
----

[discrete]
===== Producing null values

On the other hand, `nullif()` evaluates to null if its operands are equal, or to its first argument otherwise.

[[nullif-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select ifnull(nullif(author.nomDePlume, person.name), 'Real name')
from Author as author
    join author.person as person
----

[[functions-datetime]]
==== Functions for working with dates and times

There are some very important functions for working with dates and times.

[cols="15,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Special function | Purpose | Signature | JPA standard

| `extract()` | Extract a datetime field | `extract(field from x)` | âœ”
| `format()` | Format a datetime as a string | `format(datetime as pattern)` | âœ–
| `trunc()` or `truncate()` | Datetime truncation | `truncate(datetime, field)` | âœ–
|===

[[function-extract]]
[discrete]
===== Extracting date and time fields

The special function `extract()` obtains a single field of a date, time, or datetime.

- Its first argument is an expression that evaluates to a date, time, or datetime.
- Its second argument is a date/time _field type_.

Recognized Field types are listed below.

[cols="20,^15,^10,~,^15"]
|===
| Field | Type | Range | Notes | JPA standard

| `day` | `Integer` | 1-31 | Calendar day of month | âœ”
| `month` | `Integer` | 1-12 | | âœ”
| `year` | `Integer` | | | âœ”
| `week` | `Integer` | 1-53 |  ISO-8601 week number (different to `week of year`) | âœ”
| `quarter` | `Integer` | 1-4 | Quarter defined as 3 months | âœ”
| `hour` | `Integer` | 0-23 | Standard 24-hour time | âœ”
| `minute` | `Integer` | 0-59 | | âœ”
| `second` | `Float` | 0-59 | Includes fractional seconds | âœ”
| `nanosecond` | `Long` | | Granularity varies by database | âœ–
| `day of week` | `Integer` | 1-7 | | âœ–
| `day of month` | `Integer` | 1-31 | Synonym for `day` | âœ–
| `day of year` | `Integer` | 1-365 | | âœ–
| `week of month` | `Integer` | 1-5 | | âœ–
| `week of year` | `Integer` | 1-53 | | âœ–
| `epoch` | `Long` | | Elapsed seconds since January 1, 1970 | âœ–
| `date` | `LocalDate` | | Date part of a datetime | âœ”
| `time` | `LocalTime` | | Time part of a datetime | âœ”
| `offset` | `ZoneOffset` | | Timezone offset | âœ–
| `offset hour` | `Integer` | | Hours of offset | âœ–
| `offset minute` | `Integer` | 0-59 | Minutes of offset | âœ–
|===

For a full list of field types, see the Javadoc for https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/query/TemporalUnit.html[`TemporalUnit`].

[source, hql]
----
from Order where extract(date from created) = local date
----
[source, hql]
----
select extract(year from created), extract(month from created) from Order
----

The following functions are abbreviations for `extract()`:

[cols="15,~,^15"]
|===
| Function | Long form using `extract()` | JPA standard

| `year(x)` | `extract(year from x)` | âœ–
| `month(x)` | `extract(month from x)` | âœ–
| `day(x)` | `extract(day from x)` | âœ–
| `hour(x)` | `extract(hour from x)` | âœ–
| `minute(x)` | `extract(minute from x)` | âœ–
| `second(x)` | `extract(second from x)` | âœ–
|===

TIP: These abbreviations aren't part of the JPQL standard, but on the other hand they're a lot less verbose.

[source, hql]
----
select year(created), month(created) from Order
----

[[function-format]]
[discrete]
===== Formatting dates and times

The `format()` function formats a date, time, or datetime according to a pattern.

- Its first argument is an expression that evaluates to a date, time, or datetime.
- Its second argument is a formatting pattern, given as a string.

The pattern must be written in a subset of the pattern language defined by Java's `java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter`.

[source, hql]
----
select format(local datetime as 'yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')
----

For a full list of `format()` pattern elements, see the Javadoc for https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/dialect/Dialect.html#appendDatetimeFormat[`Dialect.appendDatetimeFormat`].

[[function-trunc-datetime]]
[discrete]
===== Truncating a date or time type

The `truncate()` function truncates the precision of a date, time, or datetime to the temporal unit specified by field type.

- Its first argument is an expression that evaluates to a date, time, or datetime.
- Its second argument is a date/time field type, specifying the precision of the truncated value.

Supported temporal units are: `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `minute` or `second`.

[source, hql]
----
select trunc(local datetime, hour)
----

Truncating a date, time or datetime value means obtaining a value of the same type in which all temporal units smaller than `field` have been pruned.
For hours, minutes, and seconds this means setting them to `00`. For months and days, this means setting them to `01`.

[[string-functions]]
==== Functions for working with strings

Naturally, there are a good number of functions for working with strings.

[cols="15,30,~,^15"]
|===
| Function | Purpose | Syntax | JPA standard / ANSI SQL Standard

| `upper()` | The string, with lowercase characters converted to uppercase | `upper(str)` | âœ” / âœ”
| `lower()` | The string, with uppercase characters converted to lowercase | `lower(str)` | âœ” / âœ”
| `length()` | The length of the string | `length(str)` | âœ” / âœ–
| `concat()` | Concatenate strings | `concat(x, y, z)` | âœ” / âœ–
| `locate()` | Location of string within a string | `locate(patt, str)`, +
`locate(patt, str, start)` | âœ” / âœ–
| `position()` | Similar to `locate()` | `position(patt in str)` | âœ– / âœ”
| `substring()` | Substring of a string (JPQL-style) | `substring(str, start)`, +
`substring(str, start, len)` | âœ” / âœ–
| `substring()` | Substring of a string (ANSI SQL-style)
| `substring(str from start)`, +
`substring(str from start for len)` | âœ– / âœ”
| `trim()` | Trim characters from string
| `trim(str)`, +
`trim(leading from str)`, +
`trim(trailing from str)`, or +
`trim(leading char from str)` | âœ” / âœ”
| `overlay()` | For replacing a substring
| `overlay(str placing rep from start)`, +
`overlay(str placing rep from start for len)` | âœ– / âœ”
| `pad()` | Pads a string with whitespace, or with a specified character
| `pad(str with len)`, +
`pad(str with len leading)`, +
`pad(str with len trailing)`, or +
`pad(str with len leading char)` | âœ– / âœ–
| `left()` | The leftmost characters of a string | `left(str, len)` | âœ” / âœ–
| `right()` | The rightmost characters of a string | `right(str, len)`  | âœ” / âœ–
| `replace()` | Replace every occurrence of a pattern in a string | `replace(str, patt, rep)` | âœ” / âœ–
| `repeat()` | Concatenate a string with itself multiple times | `repeat(str, times)` | âœ– / âœ–
| `collate()` | Select a collation | `collate(p.name as collation)` | âœ– / âœ–
| `hex()` | Encode a binary value as a hexadecimal string | `hex(image.bytes)` | âœ– / âœ–
|===

Let's take a closer look at just some of these.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Contrary to Java, positions of characters within strings are indexed from 1 instead of 0!
====

[discrete]
===== Concatenating strings

The JPQL-standard and ANSI SQL-standard `concat()` function accepts a variable number of arguments, and produces a string by concatenating them.

[%unbreakable]
[source, hql]
----
select concat(book.title, ' by ', listagg(author.name, ' & '))
from Book as book
    join book.authors as author
group by book
----

[discrete]
===== Finding substrings

The JPQL function `locate()` determines the position of a substring within another string.

- The first argument is the pattern to search for within the second string.
- The second argument is the string to search in.
- The optional third argument is used to specify a position at which to start the search.

[source, hql]
----
select locate('Hibernate', title) from Book
----

The `position()` function has a similar purpose, but follows the ANSI SQL syntax.

[source, hql]
----
select position('Hibernate' in title) from Book
----

[discrete]
===== Slicing strings

Unsurprisingly, `substring()` returns a substring of the given string.

- The second argument specifies the position of the first character of the substring.
- The optional third argument specifies the maximum length of the substring.

[source, hql]
----
select substring(title, 1, position(' for Dummies' in title)) from Book         /* JPQL-style */

select substring(title from 1 for position(' for Dummies' in title)) from Book  /* ANSI SQL-style */
----

Alternatively, slicing may be performed using an operator, which is just syntax sugar for the `substring()` function:

[source, hql]
----
select title[1:position(' for Dummies' in title)] from Book         /* Operator-style */
----

[source,hql]
----
select name.first[1]||name.last[1] as initials from Author
----

[discrete]
===== Trimming strings
The `trim()` function follows the syntax and semantics of ANSI SQL.
It may be used to trim `leading` characters, `trailing` characters, or both.

[source, hql]
----
select trim(title) from Book
----
[source, hql]
----
select trim(trailing ' ' from text) from Book
----

Its BNF is funky:

[source, antlrv4]
----
"TRIM" "(" (("LEADING" | "TRAILING" | "BOTH")? trimCharacter? "FROM")? expression ")" ;
----

[discrete]
===== Padding strings
The `pad()` function has a syntax inspired by `trim()`.

[source,hql]
----
select concat(pad(b.title with 40 trailing '.'),
              pad(a.firstName with 10 leading),
              pad(a.lastName with 10 leading))
from Book as b
    join b.authors as a
----

Its BNF is given by:

[source, antlrv4]
----
"PAD" "(" expression "WITH" expression ("LEADING" | "TRAILING") padCharacter? ")"
----

[[collations]]
[discrete]
===== Collations

The `collate()` function selects a collation to be used for its string-valued argument.
Collations are useful for <<relational-comparisons,binary comparisons>> with `<` or `>`, and in the <<order-by,order by clause>>.

For example, `collate(p.name as ucs_basic)` specifies the SQL standard collation `ucs_basic`.

IMPORTANT: Collations aren't very portable between databases.

TIP: Some PostgreSQL collation names must be quoted with backticks, for example, ``collate(name as \`zh_TW.UTF-8`)``.

TIP: The `@Collate` annotation may be used to specify the collation of a column, which is usually more convenient than using the `collate()` function.

[[functions-numeric]]
==== Numeric functions

Of course, we also have a number of functions for working with numeric values.

[cols="15,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Function | Purpose | Signature | JPA standard

| `abs()` | The magnitude of a number | `abs(x)` | âœ”
| `sign()` | The sign of a number | `sign(x)` | âœ”
| `mod()` | Remainder of integer division | `mod(n,d)` | âœ”
| `sqrt()` | Square root of a number | `sqrt(x)` | âœ”
| `exp()` | Exponential function | `exp(x)` | âœ”
| `power()` | Exponentiation | `power(x,y)` | âœ”
| `ln()` | Natural logarithm | `ln(x)` | âœ”
| `round()` | Numeric rounding | `round(number)`, +
`round(number, places)` | âœ”
| `trunc()` or `truncate()` | Numeric truncation | `truncate(number)`, +
`truncate(number, places)` | âœ–
| `floor()` | Floor function | `floor(x)` | âœ”
| `ceiling()` | Ceiling function | `ceiling(x)` | âœ”

| `log10()` | Base-10 logarithm | `log10(x)` | âœ–
| `log()` | Arbitrary-base logarithm | `log(b,x)` | âœ–
| `pi` | &#960; | `pi` | âœ–
| `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `asin()`, `acos()`, `atan()`
| Basic trigonometric functions | `sin(theta)`, `cos(theta)` | âœ–
| `atan2()` | Two-argument arctangent (range `(-&#960;,&#960;]`) | `atan2(y, x)` | âœ–
| `sinh()`, `cosh()`, `tanh()` | Hyperbolic functions | `sinh(x)`, `cosh(x)`, `tanh(x)` | âœ–
| `degrees()` | Convert radians to degrees | `degrees(x)` | âœ–
| `radians()` | Convert degrees to radians | `radians(x)` | âœ–
| `least()` | Return the smallest of the given arguments | `least(x, y, z)` |âœ–
| `greatest()` | Return the largest of the given arguments | `greatest(x, y, z)` | âœ–
| `bitand()`, `bitor()`, `bitxor()` | Bitwise functions | `bitand(x,y)` | âœ–
|===

We haven't included <<aggregate-functions,aggregate functions>>, <<aggregate-functions-orderedset,ordered set aggregate functions>>, or <<aggregate-functions-window,window functions>> in this list, because their purpose is more specialized, and because they come with extra special syntax.

[[functions-collections]]
==== Functions for dealing with collections

The functions described in this section are especially useful when dealing with `@ElementCollection` mappings, or with collection mappings involving an `@OrderColumn` or `@MapKeyColumn`.

The following functions accept either:

1. an identification variable that refers to a <<collection-valued-associations,joined collection or many-valued association>>, or
2. a <<path-expressions,compound path>> that refers to a collection or many-valued association of an entity.

In case 2, application of the function produces an <<implicit-collection-join,implicit join>>.

[[collection-functions]]
[cols="15,20,~,^15"]
|===
| Function | Applies to | Purpose | JPA standard

| `size()` | Any collection | The size of a collection | âœ”
| `element()` | Any collection | The element of a set or list | âœ–
| `index()` | Lists | The index of a list element | âœ”
| `key()` | Maps | The key of a map entry | âœ”
| `value()` | Maps | The value of a map entry | âœ”
| `entry()` ðŸ’€ | Maps | The whole entry in a map | âœ”
|===

The next group of functions always accept a compound path referring to a collection or many-valued association of an entity.
They're interpreted as referring to the collection as a whole.

[[collective-collection-functions]]
[cols="15,20,~,^15"]
|===
| Function | Applies to | Purpose | JPA standard

| `elements()` | Any collection | The elements of a set or list, collectively | âœ–
| `indices()` | Lists | The indexes of a list, collectively | âœ–
| `keys()` | Maps | The keys of a map, collectively | âœ–
| `values()` | Maps | The values of a map, collectively | âœ–
|===
Application of one of these functions produces an implicit subquery or implicit join.

This query has an implicit join:

[[elements-join-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select title, element(tags) from Book
----

This query has an implicit subquery:

[[elements-subquery-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select title from Book where 'hibernate' in elements(tags)
----

NOTE: It never makes sense to apply the functions `elements()`, `indices()`, `keys()`, or `values()` to an identification variable or single-valued path expression.
These functions must be applied to a reference to a many-valued path expression.

[discrete]
===== Collection sizes

The `size()` function returns the number of elements of a collection or to-many association.

[[size-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select name, size(books) from Author
----

[[set-functions]]
[discrete]
===== Set or list elements

The `element()` function returns a reference to an element of a joined set or list.
For an identification variable (case 1 above), this function is optional.
For a compound path (case 2), it's required.

[[list-functions]]
[discrete]
===== List indexes

The `index()` function returns a reference to the index of a joined list.

In this example, `element()` is optional, but `index()` is required:

[[index-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select id(book), index(ed), element(ed)
from Book book as book
    join book.editions as ed
----

[[map-functions]]
[discrete]
===== Map keys and values

The `key()` function returns a reference to a key of a joined map.
The `value()` function returns a reference to its value.

[[key-value-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select key(entry), value(entry)
from Thing as thing
    join thing.entries as entry
----

[[elements-indices]]
===== Quantification over collections

The functions `elements()`, `indices()`, `keys()`, and `values()` are used to quantify over collections.
We may use them with:

- an <<in-predicate,`in`>> or <<exists-predicate,`exists`>> predicate,
- a <<relational-comparisons-subqueries,relational comparison>>, or
- an <<aggregate-functions-collections,aggregate function>>.

[cols="35,~"]
|===
| Shortcut | Equivalent subquery

| `exists elements(book.editions)` | `exists (select ed from book.editions as ed)`
| `2 in indices(book.editions)` | `2 in (select index(ed) from book.editions as ed)`
| `10 > all(elements(book.printings))` | `10 > all(select pr from book.printings as pr)`
| `max(elements(book.printings))` | `(select max(pr) from book.printings as pr)`
|===

For example:

[source, hql]
----
select title from Book where 'hibernate' in elements(tags)
----

Don't confuse the `elements()` function with `element()`, the `indices()` function with `index()`, the `keys()` function with `key()`, or the `values()` function with `value()`.
The functions named in singular deal with elements of "flattened" collections.
If not already joined, they add an implicit join to the query.
The functions with plural naming do _not_ flatten a collection by joining it.

[%unbreakable]
[IMPORTANT]
====
The following queries are different:
[source, hql]
----
select title, max(index(revisions)) from Book  /* implicit join */
----
[source, hql]
----
select title, max(indices(revisions)) from Book  /* implicit subquery */
----
The first query produces a single row, with `max()` taken over all books.
The second query produces a row per book, with `max()` taken over the collection elements belonging to the given book.
====

[[functions-model]]
==== Functions for working with ids and versions

Finally, the following functions evaluate the id, version, or natural id of an entity, or the foreign key of a to-one association:

[[model-functions]]
[cols="12,~,^15"]
|===
| Function | Purpose | JPA standard

| `id()` | The value of the entity `@Id` attribute. | âœ”
| `version()` | The value of the entity `@Version` attribute. | âœ”
| `naturalid()` | The value of the entity `@NaturalId` attribute. | âœ–
| `fk()` | The value of the foreign key column mapped by a `@ManyToOne` (or logical `@OneToOne`) association.
Useful with associations annotated `@NotFound`. | âœ–
|===

[[array-functions]]
==== Array, XML, and JSON functions

On supported platforms, HQL provides a rich suite of functions for working with:

- link:{doc-user-guide-url}#hql-functions-arrays[SQL arrays],
- link:{doc-user-guide-url}#hql-functions-json[JSON], and
- link:{doc-user-guide-url}#hql-functions-xml[XML]

The use of these functions is outside the scope of this guide.
However, we note that the following language constructs work with arrays, and are implemented as syntactic sugar for the underlying functions:

[[array-syntax-sugar]]
|===
| Syntax | Interpretation

| `[1, 2]` | Instantiate an array
| `array[1]` | Array element
| `array[1:2]` | Array slice
| `length(array)` | Length of an array
| `position(element in array)` | Position of an element within an array
| `cast(array as String)` | Typecast array to string
| `element in array` or `array contains element` | Determine if an element belongs to an array
| `array includes subarray` | Determine if the elements of one array include all the elements of a second array
|===

[[functions-hash]]
==== Hash functions

The following functions work on most supported platforms:

[[hash-functions]]
[cols="12,~,^15"]
|===
| Function | Purpose | JPA standard

| `sha()` | The SHA256 hash of a string. | âœ–
| `md5()` | The MD5 hash of a string. | âœ–
|===

These functions accept a string and return `byte[]`.
The return value is compatible with the byte array produced by Java's `MessageDigest`.

[[embedding-sql]]
==== Embedding SQL expressions

The following special functions let us embed a call to a native SQL function, refer directly to a column, or evaluate an expression written in native SQL.

[[sql-embedding-functions]]
[cols="12,~,35,^15"]
|===
| Function | Purpose | Signature | JPA standard

| `function()` | Call a SQL function
| `function('fun', arg1, arg2)`
| âœ”
| `function()` | Call a SQL function
| `function(fun, arg1, arg2)`, +
`function(fun as Type, arg1, arg2)`
| âœ–
| `column()` | A column value | `column(entity.column)`, +
`column(entity.column as Type)`
| âœ–
| `sql()` | Evaluate a SQL expression
| `sql('text', arg1, arg2)`
| âœ–
|===

TIP: Before using one of these functions, ask yourself if it might be better to just write the whole query in native SQL.

[[column-references]]
===== Direct column references

The `column()` function lets us refer to an unmapped column of a table.
The column name must be qualified by an identification variable or path expression.

[source,hql]
----
select column(log.ctid as String)
from Log log
----

Of course, the table itself must be mapped by an entity class.

[[user-defined-functions]]
===== Native and user-defined functions

The functions we've described above are the functions abstracted by HQL and made portable across databases.
But, of course, HQL can't abstract every function in your database.

There are several ways to call native or user-defined SQL functions.

- A native or user-defined function may be called using JPQL's `function` syntax, for example, ``function('sinh', phi)``, or HQL's extension to that syntax, for example ``function(sinh as Double, phi)``.
(This is the easiest way, but not the best way.)
- A user-written `FunctionContributor` may register user-defined functions.
- A custom `Dialect` may register additional native functions by overriding `initializeFunctionRegistry()`.

[TIP]
====
Registering a function isn't hard, but is beyond the scope of this guide.

(It's even possible to use the APIs Hibernate provides to make your own _portable_ functions!)
====

Fortunately, every built-in `Dialect` already registers many native functions for the database it supports.

[TIP]
====
Try setting the log category `org.hibernate.HQL_FUNCTIONS` to debug.
Then at startup Hibernate will log a list of type signatures of all registered functions.
====


[[function-sql]]
===== Embedding native SQL in HQL

The special function `sql()` allows the use of native SQL fragments inside an HQL query.

The signature of this function is `sql(pattern[, argN]*)`, where `pattern` must be a string literal but the remaining arguments may be of any type.
The pattern literal is unquoted and embedded in the generated SQL.
Occurrences of `?` in the pattern are replaced with the remaining arguments of the function.

We may use this, for example, to perform a native PostgreSQL typecast:
[source, hql]
----
from Computer c where c.ipAddress = sql('?::inet', '127.0.0.1')
----
This results in SQL logically equivalent to:
[source, sql]
----
select * from Computer c where c.ipAddress = '127.0.0.1'::inet
----
Or we can use a native SQL operator:
[source, hql]
----
from Human h order by sql('(? <-> ?)', h.workLocation, h.homeLocation)
----
And this time the SQL is logically equivalent to:
[source, sql]
----
select * from Human h where (h.workLocation <-> h.homeLocation)
----

[[conditional-expressions]]
=== Predicates

A predicate is an operator which, when applied to some argument, evaluates to `true` or `false`.
In the world of SQL-style ternary logic, we must expand this definition to encompass the possibility that the predicate evaluates to `null`.
Typically, a predicate evaluates to `null` when one of its arguments is `null`.

Predicates occur in the `where` clause, the `having` clause and in searched case expressions.

[[relational-comparisons]]
==== Comparison operators

The binary comparison operators are borrowed from SQL: `=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `\<=`, `<>`.

TIP: If you prefer, HQL treats `!=` as a synonym for `<>`.

The operands should be of the same type.

[[relational-comparisons-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book where price < 1.0
----
[source, hql]
----
from Author as author where author.nomDePlume <> author.person.name
----
[source, hql]
----
select id, total
from (
    select ord.id as id, sum(item.book.price * item.quantity) as total
    from Order as ord
        join Item as item
    group by ord
)
where total > 100.0
----

[[between-predicate]]
==== The `between` predicate

The ternary `between` operator, and its negation, `not between`, determine if a value falls within a range.

Of course, all three operands must be of compatible type.

[[between-predicate-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book where price between 1.0 and 100.0
----

[[null-predicate]]
==== Operators for dealing with null

The following operators make it easier to deal with null values.
These predicates never evaluate to `null`.

[cols="20,20,15,~"]
|===
| Operator | Negation | Type | Semantics

| `is null` | `is not null` | Unary postfix | `true` if the value to the left is null, or false if it is not null
| `is distinct from` | `is not distinct from` | Binary | `true` if the value on the left is equal to the value on the right, or if both values are null, and false otherwise
|===

[[null-predicate-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Author where nomDePlume is not null
----

[[boolean-predicate]]
==== Operators for dealing with boolean values

These operators perform comparisons on values of type `boolean`.
These predicates never evaluate to `null`.

[NOTE]
====
The values `true` and `false` of the `boolean` basic type are different to the logical `true` or `false` produced by a predicate.
====

For _logical_ operations on <<conditional-expressions,predicates>>, see <<logical-operators>> below.

[cols="20,20,15,~"]
|===
| Operator | Negation | Type | Semantics

| `is true` | `is not true` | Unary postfix | `true` if the value to the left is `true`, or `false` otherwise
| `is false` | `is not false` | Binary | `true` if the value to the left is `false`, or `false` otherwise
|===

[[boolean-predicate-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book where discontinued is not true
----

[[collection-operators]]
==== Collection predicates

The following operators apply to collection-valued attributes and to-many associations.

[cols="15,15,20,~"]
|===
| Operator | Negation | Type | Semantics

| `is empty` | `is not empty` | Unary postfix | `true` if the collection or association on the left has no elements
| `member of` | `not member of` | Binary | `true` if the value on the left is a member of the collection or association on the right
|===

[[empty-collection-predicate-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Author where books is empty
----

[[member-of-collection-predicate-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select author, book
from Author as author, Book as book
where author member of book.authors
----

[[like-predicate]]
==== String pattern matching

The `like` operator performs pattern matching on strings.
Its friend `ilike` performs case-insensitive matching.

Their syntax is defined by:

[[like-predicate-bnf]]
[source, antlrv4]
----
include::{extrasdir}/predicate_like_bnf.txt[]
----

The expression on the right is usually a SQL-style pattern, where:

* `_` matches any single character,
* `%` matches any number of characters, and
* if an escape character is specified, it may be used to escape either of these wildcards.

[[like-predicate-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book where title not like '% for Dummies'
----

The optional `escape` character allows a pattern to include a literal `_` or `%` character.

Alternatively, the `regexp` keyword specifies that the pattern should be interpreted as a regular expression:

[[like-regexp-predicate-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book where title not like regexp '.+ for Dummies'
----

As you can guess, `not like` and `not ilike` are the enemies of `like` and `ilike`, and evaluate to the exact opposite boolean values.

[[in-predicate]]
==== The `in` predicate

The `in` predicates evaluates to true if the value to its left is in ... well, whatever it finds to its right.

Its syntax is unexpectedly complicated:

[[in-predicate-bnf]]
[source, antlrv4, indent=0]
----
include::{extrasdir}/predicate_in_bnf.txt[]
----

This less-than-lovely fragment of the HQL ANTLR grammar tells us that the thing to the right might be:

- a list of values enclosed in parentheses,
- a subquery,
- one of the collection-handling functions defined <<elements-indices,above>>,
- a query parameter, or
- an expression evaluating to a link:{doc-introduction-url}#arrays[SQL array].

The type of the expression on the left, and the types of all the values on the right must be compatible.

[%unbreakable]
[NOTE]
====
JPQL limits the legal types to string, numeric, date/time, and enum types, and in JPQL the left expression must be either:

- a _state field_, which means a basic attribute, excluding associations and embedded attributes, or
- an <<functions-typecasts,_entity type expression_>>.

HQL is far more permissive. HQL itself does not restrict the type in any way, though the database itself might.
Even embedded attributes are allowed, although that feature depends on the level of support for tuple or "row value" constructors in the underlying database.
====

[[in-predicate-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Payment as payment
where type(payment) in (CreditCardPayment, WireTransferPayment)
----
[source, hql]
----
from Author as author
where author.person.name in (select name from OldAuthorData)
----
[source, hql]
----
from Book as book
where :edition in elements(book.editions)
----

It's quite common to have a parameterized list of values.

[%unbreakable]
[TIP]
====
Here's a very useful idiom:
[source,java]
----
List<Book> books =
        session.createSelectionQuery("from Book where isbn in :isbns", Book.class)
            .setParameterList("isbns", listOfIsbns)
            .getResultList();
----
====

We may even "vectorize" an `in` predicate, using a tuple constructor and a subquery with multiple selection items:

[%unbreakable]
[source, hql]
----
from Author as author
where (author.person.name, author.person.birthdate)
    in (select name, birthdate from OldAuthorData)
----

[[relational-comparisons-subqueries]]
==== Comparison operators and subqueries

The binary comparisons we met <<relational-comparisons,above>> may involve a quantifier, either:

- a quantified subquery, or
- a quantifier applied to one of the functions defined <<elements-indices,above>>.

The quantifiers are unary prefix operators: `all`, `every`, `any`, and `some`.

[cols="10,10,~"]

[[exists-predicate]]
==== The `exists` predicate

The unary prefix `exists` operator evaluates to true if the thing to its right is nonempty.

The thing to its right might be:

- a subquery, or
- one of the functions defined <<elements-indices,above>>.

As you can surely guess, `not exists` evaluates to true if the thing to the right _is_ empty.

[[logical-operators]]
==== Logical operators

The logical operators are binary infix `and` and `or`, and unary prefix `not`.

Just like SQL, logical expressions are based on ternary logic.
A logical operator evaluates to null if it has a null operand.
