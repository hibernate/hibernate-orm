[[root-entities-and-joins]]
== Root entities and joins

The `from` clause, and its subordinate `join` clauses sit right at the heart of most queries.

[[from-clause]]
=== Declaring root entities

The `from` clause is responsible for declaring the entities available in the rest of the query, and assigning them aliases, or, in the language of the JPQL specification, _identification variables_.

[[identification-variables]]
==== Identification variables

An identification variable is just a name we can use to refer to an entity and its attributes from expressions in the query.
It may be any legal Java identifier.
According to the JPQL specification, identification variables must be treated as case-insensitive language elements.

[TIP]
====
The identification variable is actually optional, but for queries involving more than one entity it's almost always a good idea to declare one.

This _works_, but it isn't particularly good form:
[source,hql]
----
from Publisher join books join authors join person where ssn = :ssn
----
====

Identification variables may be declared with the `as` keyword, but this is optional.

[[root-reference]]
==== Root entity references

A root entity reference, or what the JPQL specification calls a _range variable declaration_, is a direct reference to a mapped `@Entity` type by its entity name.

[TIP]
====
Remember, the _entity name_ is the value of the `name` member of the `@Entity` annotation, or the unqualified Java class name by default.
====

[[root-reference-jpql-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select book from Book as book
----

In this example, `Book` is the entity name, and `book` is the identification variable.
The `as` keyword is optional.

Alternatively, a fully-qualified Java class name may be specified.
Then Hibernate will query every entity which inherits the named type.

[[root-reference-jpql-fqn-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select doc from org.hibernate.example.AbstractDocument as doc where doc.text like :pattern
----

Of course, there may be multiple root entities.

[[multiple-root-reference-jpql-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select a, b
from Author a, Author b, Book book
where a in elements(book.authors)
  and b in elements(book.authors)
----

This query may even be written using the syntax `cross join` in place of the commas:

[[cross-join-jpql-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select a, b
from Book book
    cross join Author a
    cross join Author b
where a in elements(book.authors)
  and b in elements(book.authors)
----

Of course, it's possible to write old-fashioned pre-ANSI-era joins:

[source, hql]
----
select book.title, publisher.name
from Book book, Publisher publisher
where book.publisher = publisher
  and book.title like :titlePattern
----

But we never write HQL this way.

[[polymorphism]]
==== Polymorphism

HQL and JPQL queries are inherently polymorphic.
Consider:

[[polymorphism-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select payment from Payment as payment
----

This query names the `Payment` entity explicitly.
But the `CreditCardPayment` and `WireTransferPayment` entities inherit `Payment`, and so `payment` ranges over all three types.
Instances of all these entities are returned by the query.

[NOTE]
====
The query `from java.lang.Object` is completely legal. (But not very useful!)

It returns every object of every mapped entity type.
====

// This behavior may be slightly adjusted using the `@Polymorphism` annotation.
//
// See <<chapters/domain/inheritance.adoc#entity-inheritance-polymorphism>> for more.

[[derived-root]]
==== Derived roots

A _derived root_ is an uncorrelated subquery which occurs in the `from` clause.

[[derived-root-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select id, total
from (
    select ord.id as id, sum(item.book.price * item.quantity) as total
    from Order as ord
        join ord.items as item
    group by ord
)
where total > 100.0
----

The derived root may declare an identification variable.

[source, hql]
----
select stuff.id, stuff.total
from (
    select ord.id as id, sum(item.book.price * item.quantity) as total
    from Order as ord
        join ord.items as item
    group by ord
) as stuff
where total > 100.0
----

This feature can be used to break a more complicated query into smaller pieces.

[IMPORTANT]
====
We emphasize that a derived root must be an _uncorrelated_ subquery.
It may not refer to other roots declared in the same `from` clause.
====

A subquery may also occur in a <<join-derived, join>>, in which case it may be a correlated subquery.

[[from-cte]]
==== Common table expressions in `from` clause

A _common table expression (CTE)_ is like a derived root with a name.
We'll discuss CTEs <<with-cte,later>>.

[[join]]
=== Declaring joined entities

Joins allow us to navigate from one entity to another, via its associations, or via explicit join conditions.
There are:

- _explicit joins_, declared within the `from` clause using the keyword ``join``, and
- _implicit joins_, which don't need to be declared in the `from` clause.

An explicit join may be either:

* an _inner join_, written as `join` or `inner join`,
* a _left outer join_, written as `left join` or `left outer join`,
* a _right outer join_, written as `right join` or `right outer join`, or
* a _full outer join_, written as `full join` or `full outer join`.

[[root-join]]
==== Explicit root joins

An explicit root join works just like an ANSI-style join in SQL.

[[explicit-root-join-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select book.title, publisher.name
from Book book
    join Publisher publisher
        on book.publisher = publisher
where book.title like :titlePattern
----

The join condition is written out explicitly in the `on` clause.

[NOTE]
====
This looks nice and familiar, but it's _not_ the most common sort of join in HQL or JPQL.
====

[[explicit-join]]
==== Explicit association joins

Every explicit association join specifies an entity attribute to be joined.
The specified attribute:

* is usually a `@OneToMany`, `@ManyToMany`, `@OneToOne`, or `@ManyToOne` association, but
* it could be an `@ElementCollection`, or even just a link:{doc-introduction-url}#arrays[SQL array], and
* it might even be an attribute of embeddable type.

In the case of an association or collection, the generated SQL will have a join of the same type.
(For a many-to-many association it will have _two_ joins.)
In the case of an embedded attribute, the join is purely logical and does not result in a join in the generated SQL.

An explicit join may assign an identification variable to the joined entity.

[[explicit-inner-join-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book as book
    join book.publisher as publisher
    join book.authors as author
where book.title like :titlePattern
select book.title, author.name, publisher.name
----

For an outer join, we must write our query to accommodate the possibility that the joined association is missing.

[[explicit-outer-join-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book as book
    left join book.publisher as publisher
    join book.authors as author
where book.title like :titlePattern
select book.title, author.name, ifnull(publisher.name, '-')
----

For further information about collection-valued association references, see <<collection-valued-associations>>.

[[explicit-join-conditions]]
==== Explicit association joins with join conditions

The `with` or `on` clause allows explicit qualification of the join conditions.

[NOTE]
====
The specified join conditions are _added_ to the join conditions specified by the foreign key association.
That's why, historically, HQL uses the keword `with` here:
"with" emphasizes that the new condition doesn't _replace_ the original join conditions.

The `with` keyword is specific to Hibernate. JPQL uses `on`.
====

Join conditions occurring in the `with` or `on` clause are added to the `on` clause in the generated SQL.

[[explicit-join-with-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book as book
    left join book.publisher as publisher
        with publisher.closureDate is not null
    left join book.authors as author
        with author.type <> COLLABORATION
where book.title like :titlePattern
select book.title, author.name, publisher.name
----

// The following query is arguably less clear, but it's semantically identical:
//
// [[explicit-join-jpql-on-example]]
// [source, hql]
// ----
// from Book as book
//     left join book.publisher as publisher
//         on publisher.closureDate is not null
//     left join book.authors as author
//         on author.type <> COLLABORATION
// where book.title like :titlePattern
// select book.title, author.name, publisher.name
// ----

[[explicit-fetch-join]]
==== Association fetching

A _fetch join_  overrides the laziness of a given association, specifying that the association should be fetched with a SQL join.
The join may be an inner or outer join.

* A `join fetch`, or, more explicitly, `inner join fetch`, only returns base entities with an associated entity.
* A `left join fetch`, or—for lovers of verbosity—``left outer join fetch``, returns all the base entities, including those which have no associated joined entity.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This is one of the most important features of Hibernate.
To achieve acceptable performance with HQL, you'll need to use `join fetch` quite often.
Without it, you'll quickly run into the dreaded "n+1 selects" problem.
====

For example, if `Person` has a one-to-many association named `phones`, the use of `join fetch` in the following query specifies that the collection elements should be fetched in the same SQL query:

[[explicit-fetch-join-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select book
from Book as book
    left join fetch book.publisher
    join fetch book.authors
----

In this example, we used a left outer join for `book.publisher` because we also wanted to obtain books with no publisher, but a regular inner join for `book.authors` because every book has at least one author.

A query may have more than one fetch join, but be aware that:

* it's perfectly safe to fetch several to-one associations in series or parallel in a single query, and
* a single series of _nested_ fetch joins is also fine, but
* fetching multiple collections or to-many associations in _parallel_ results in a Cartesian product at the database level, and might exhibit very poor performance.

HQL doesn't disallow it, but it's usually a bad idea to apply a restriction to a ``join fetch``ed entity, since the elements of the fetched collection would be incomplete.
Indeed, it's best to avoid even assigning an identification variable to a fetched joined entity except for the purpose of specifying a nested fetch join.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Fetch joins should usually be avoided in limited or paged queries.
This includes:

- queries executed with limits specified via the `setFirstResult()` and `setMaxResults()` methods of `Query`, or
- queries with a limit or offset declared in HQL, described below in <<limit-offset>>.

Nor should they be used with the `scroll()` and `stream()` methods of the `Query` interface.
====

Fetch joins are disallowed in subqueries, where they would make no sense.

[[join-treat]]
==== Joins with typecasts

An explicit join may narrow the type of the joined entity using `treat()`.

[[join-treat-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Order as ord
    join treat(ord.payments as CreditCardPayment) as ccp
where length(ccp.cardNumber) between 16 and 20
select ord.id, ccp.cardNumber, ccp.amount
----

Here, the identification variable `ccp` declared to the right of `treat()` has the narrowed type `CreditCardPayment`, instead of the declared type `Payment`.
This allows the attribute `cardNumber` declared by the subtype `CreditCardPayment` to be referenced in the rest of the query.

See <<functions-typecasts>> for more information about `treat()`.

[[join-derived]]
==== Subqueries in joins

A `join` clause may contain a subquery, either:

- an uncorrelated subquery, which is almost the same as a <<derived-root,derived root>>, except that it may have an `on` restriction, or
- a _lateral join_, which is a correlated subquery, and may refer to other roots declared earlier in the same `from` clause.

The `lateral` keyword just distinguishes the two cases.

[[derived-join-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Phone as phone
    left join (
        select call.duration as duration, call.phone.id as cid
        from Call as call
        order by call.duration desc
        limit 1
    ) as longest on cid = phone.id
where phone.number = :phoneNumber
select longest.duration
----

This query may also be expressed using a `lateral` join:

[source, hql]
----
from Phone as phone
    left join lateral (
       select call.duration as duration
       from phone.calls as call
       order by call.duration desc
       limit 1
    ) as longest
where phone.number = :phoneNumber
select longest.duration
----

A lateral join may be an inner or left outer join, but not a right join, nor a full join.

[TIP]
====
Traditional SQL doesn't allow correlated subqueries in the `from` clause.
A lateral join is essentially just that, but with a different syntax to what you might expect.

On some databases, `join lateral` is written `cross apply`.
And on Postgres it's plain `lateral`, without `join`.

It's almost as if they're _deliberately trying_ to confuse us.
====

Lateral joins are particularly useful for computing top-N elements of multiple groups.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Most databases support some flavor of `join lateral`, and Hibernate emulates the feature for databases which don't.
But emulation is neither very efficient, nor does it support all possible query shapes, so it's important to test on your target database.
====

[[implicit-join]]
==== Implicit association joins (path expressions)

It's not necessary to explicitly `join` every entity that occurs in a query.
Instead, entity associations may be _navigated_, just like in Java:

* if an attribute is of embedded type, or is a to-one association, it may be further navigated, but
* if an attribute is of basic type, it is considered terminal, and may not be further navigated, and
* if an attribute is collection-valued, or is a to-many association, it may be navigated, but only with the help of `value()`, `element()`, or `key()`.

It's clear that:

* A path expression like `author.name` with only two elements just refers to state held directly by an entity with an alias `author` defined in `from` or `join`.
* But a longer path expression, for example, `author.person.name`, might refer to state held by an associated entity.
(Alternatively, it might refer to state held by an embedded class.)

In the second case, Hibernate with automatically add a join to the generated SQL if necessary.

[[implicit-join-example]]
[source, hql]
----
from Book as book
where book.publisher.name like :pubName
----

As in this example, implicit joins usually appear outside the `from` clause of the HQL query.
However, they always affect the `from` clause of the SQL query.

The example above is equivalent to:

[[implicit-join-alt]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select book
from Book as book
    join book.publisher as pub
where pub.name like :pubName
----

Note that:

* Implicit joins are always treated as inner joins.
* Multiple occurrences of the same implicit join always refer to the same SQL join.

This query:

[[implicit-join-alias-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select book
from Book as book
where book.publisher.name like :pubName
  and book.publisher.closureDate is null
----

results in just one SQL join, and is just a different way to write:

[[implicit-join-alias-alt]]
[source, hql]
----
select book
from Book as book
    join book.publisher as pub
where pub.name like :pubName
  and pub.closureDate is null
----

[[collection-valued-associations]]
==== Joining collections and many-valued associations

When a join involves a collection or many-valued association, by default, the declared identification variable refers to the _elements_ of the collection, that is:

- to the elements of a `Set`,
- to the elements of a `List`, not to their indices in the list, or
- to the values of a `Map`, not to their keys.

[[collection-valued-associations-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select publisher.name, author.name
from Publisher as publisher
    join publisher.books as book
    join book.authors as author
where author.name like :namePattern
----

In this example, the identification variable `author` is of type `Author`, the element type of the list `Book.authors`.
But if we need to refer to the index of an `Author` in the list, we need some extra syntax.

You might recall that we mentioned <<list-functions>> and <<map-functions>> a bit earlier.
These functions may be applied to the identification variable declared in a collection join or many-valued association join.

[cols="12,20,~,~"]
|===
| Function | Applies to | Interpretation | Notes

| `value()` or `element()` | Any collection | The collection element or map entry value
| Often optional.
| `index()` | Any `List` with an index column | The index of the element in the list
| For backward compatibility, it's also an alternative to ``key()``, when applied to a map.
| `key()` | Any `Map` | The key of the entry in the map | If the key is of entity type, it may be further navigated.
| `entry()` | Any `Map` | The map entry, that is, the `Map.Entry` of key and value.
| Only legal as a terminal path, and only allowed in the `select` clause.
|===

In particular, `index()` and `key()` obtain a reference to a list index or map key.

[[collection-qualification-example]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select book.title, author.name, index(author)
from Book as book
    join book.authors as author
----
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select publisher.name, leadAuthor.name
from Publisher as publisher
    join publisher.books as book
    join book.authors as leadAuthor
where leadAuthor.name like :namePattern
  and index(leadAuthor) == 0
----

[source, hql]
----
select book.isbn, key(translation).language, key(translation).country
from Book book
join book.translations as translation
----

If the key of a map is an entity type, then HQL (but not JPQL) lets us use the `key()` function in the `join` clause:

[source, hql]
----
select book.isbn, lang.language, lang.country, lang.variant
from Book book
join key(book.translations) as lang
----

It's also legal, but redundant, to use the `value()` function in the `join` clause when the value of a map is an entity type.

[source, hql]
----
select book.isbn, trans.isbn, book.title, trans.title
from Book book
join value(book.translations) as trans  /* redundant use of value() */
----


[[implicit-collection-join]]
==== Implicit joins involving collections

A path expression like `book.authors.name` is not considered legal.
We can't just navigate a many-valued association with this syntax.

Instead, the functions `element()`, `index()`, `key()`, and `value()` may be applied to a path expression to express an implicit join.
So we must write `element(book.authors).name` or `index(book.authors)`.

[[collection-implicit-join-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select book.title, element(book.authors).name, index(book.authors)
from Book book
----

An element of an indexed collection (an array, list, or map) may even be identified using the index operator:

[[collection-index-operator-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select publisher.name, book.authors[0].name
from Publisher as publisher
    join publisher.books as book
where book.authors[0].name like :namePattern
----
