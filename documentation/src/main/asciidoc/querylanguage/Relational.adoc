[[selection-projection-aggregation]]
== Selection, projection, and aggregation

Joining is one kind of _relational operation_.
It's an operation that produces relations (tables) from other relations.
Such operations, taken together, form the _relational algebra_.

We must now understand the rest of this family: restriction a.k.a. selection, projection, aggregation, union/intersection, and, finally, ordering and limiting, operations which are not strictly part of the calculus of relations, but which usually come along for the ride because they're very _useful_.

We'll start with the operation that's easiest to understand.

[[where-clause]]
=== Restriction

The `where` clause restricts the results returned by a `select` query or limits the scope of an `update` or `delete` query.

NOTE: This operation is usually called _selection_, but since that term is often confused with the `select` keyword, and since both projection and selection involve "selecting" things, here we'll use the less-ambiguous term _restriction_.

A restriction is nothing more than a single logical expression, a topic we exhausted above in <<conditional-expressions>>.
Therefore, we'll move quickly onto the next, and more interesting, operation.

[[aggregation]]
=== Aggregation

An aggregate query is one with <<aggregate-functions,aggregate functions>> in its projection list.
It collapses multiple rows into a single row.
Aggregate queries are used for summarizing and analysing data.

An aggregate query might have a `group by` clause.
The `group by` clause divides the result set into groups, so that a query with aggregate functions in the select list returns not a single result for the whole query, but one result for each group.
If an aggregate query _doesn't_ have a `group by` clause, it always produces a single row of results.

NOTE: In short, _grouping_ controls the effect of _aggregation_.

A query with aggregation may also have a `having` clause, a restriction applied to the groups.

[[group-by]]
==== Aggregation and grouping

The `group by` clause looks quite similar to the `select` clauseâ€”it has a list of grouped items, but:

- if there's just one item, then the query will have a single result for each unique value of that item, or
- if there are multiple items, the query will have a result for each unique _combination_ or their values.

The BNF for a grouped item is just:

[[group-by-item-bnf]]
[source, antlrv4]
----
include::{extrasdir}/group_by_item_bnf.txt[]
----

Consider the following queries:

[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select book.isbn,
    sum(quantity) as totalSold,
    sum(quantity * book.price) as totalBilled
from Item
where book.isbn = :isbn
----

[[group-by-example]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select book.isbn,
    year(order.dateTime) as year,
    sum(quantity) as yearlyTotalSold,
    sum(quantity * book.price) as yearlyTotalBilled
from Item
where book.isbn = :isbn
group by year(order.dateTime)
----

The first query calculates complete totals over all orders in years.
The second calculates totals for each year, after grouping the orders by year.

[[group-by-rollup-cube]]
==== Totals and subtotals

The special functions `rollup()` and `cube()` may be used in the `group by` clause, when supported by the database.
The semantics are identical to SQL.

These functions are especially useful for reporting.

* A `group by` clause with `rollup()` is used to produce subtotals and grand totals.
* A `group by` clause with `cube()` allows totals for every combination of columns.

[[having]]
==== Aggregation and restriction

In a grouped query, the `where` clause applies to the non-aggregated values (it determines which rows will make it into the aggregation).
The `having` clause also restricts results, but it operates on the aggregated values.

In an <<group-by-example,example above>>, we calculated totals for every year for which data was available.
But our dataset might extend far back into the past, perhaps even as far back as those terrible dark ages before Hibernate 2.0.
So let's restrict our result set to data from our own more civilized times:

[[group-by-having-example]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select book.isbn,
    year(order.dateTime) as year,
    sum(quantity) as yearlyTotalSold,
    sum(quantity * book.price) as yearlyTotalBilled
from Item
where book.isbn = :isbn
group by year(order.dateTime)
having year(order.dateTime) > 2003
   and sum(quantity) > 0
----

The `having` clause follows the same rules as the `where` clause and is also just a logical predicate.
The `having` restriction is applied after grouping and aggregation has already been performed, whereas the `where` clause is applied before the data is grouped or aggregated.

[[select-clause]]
=== Projection

The `select` list identifies which objects and values to return as the query results.
This operation is called _projection_.

[source,antlrv4]
----
selectClause
    : "SELECT" "DISTINCT"? selection (","" selection)*
----

Any of the expression types discussed in <<expressions>> may occur in the projection list, unless otherwise noted.

[TIP]
====
If a query has no explicit `select` list, then, as we saw <<select-simplest-example,much earlier>>, the projection is inferred from the entities and joins occurring in the `from` clause, together with the result type specified by the call to `createQuery()`.
But it's better to specify the projection explicitly, except in the simplest cases.
====

[[distinct]]
==== Duplicate removal

The `distinct` keyword helps remove duplicate results from the query result list.
Its only effect is to add `distinct` to the generated SQL.

[[distinct-projection-query-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select distinct lastName from Person
----
[source, hql]
----
select distinct author
from Publisher as pub
    join pub.books as book
    join book.authors as author
where pub.id = :pid
----


[NOTE]
====
As of Hibernate 6, duplicate results arising from the use of `join fetch` are automatically removed by Hibernate in memory, _after_ reading the database results and materializing entity instances as Java objects.
It's no longer necessary to remove duplicate results explicitly, and, in particular, `distinct` should not be used for this purpose.
====

[[aggregate-functions]]
==== Aggregate functions

It's common to have aggregate functions like `count()`, `sum()`, and `max()` in a select list.
Aggregate functions are special functions that reduce the size of the result set.

The standard aggregate functions defined in both ANSI SQL and JPQL are these ones:

[cols="30,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Aggregate function | Argument type | Result type | JPA standard / ANSI SQL standard

| `count()`, including `count(distinct)`, `count(all)`, and `count(*)` | Any | `Long` | âœ”/âœ”
| `avg()` | Any numeric type | `Double` | âœ”/âœ”
| `median()` | Any numeric type | `Double` | âœ–/âœ–
| `min()` | Any numeric type, or string | Same as the argument type | âœ”/âœ”
| `max()` | Any numeric type, or string | Same as the argument type | âœ”/âœ”
| `sum()` | Any numeric type | See table below | âœ”/âœ”
| `var_pop()`, `var_samp()` | Any numeric type | `Double` | âœ–/âœ”
| `stddev_pop()`, `stddev_samp()` | Any numeric type | `Double` | âœ–/âœ”
|===

[NOTE]
The `median()` function is not supported on MySQL or Sybase ASE.

[[aggregate-functions-example]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select count(distinct item.book)
from Item as item
where year(item.order.dateTime) = :year
----
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select sum(item.quantity) as totalSales
from Item as item
where item.book.isbn = :isbn
----
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select
    year(item.order.dateTime) as year,
    sum(item.quantity) as yearlyTotal
from Item as item
where item.book.isbn = :isbn
group by year(item.order.dateTime)
----
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select
    month(item.order.dateTime) as month,
    avg(item.quantity) as monthlyAverage
from Item as item
where item.book.isbn = :isbn
group by month(item.order.dateTime)
----

In the case of `sum()`, the rules for assigning a result type are:
|===
| Argument type | Result type

| Any integral numeric type except `BigInteger` | `Long`
| Any floating point numeric type | `Double`
| `BigInteger` | `BigInteger`
| `BigDecimal` |  `BigDecimal`
|===

HQL defines two additional aggregate functions which accept a logical predicate as an argument.

[cols="30,~,~,^15"]
|===
| Aggregate function | Argument type | Result type | JPA standard

| `any()` or `some()` | Logical predicate | `Boolean` | âœ–
| `every()` or `all()` | Logical predicate | `Boolean` | âœ–
|===

We may write, for example, `every(p.amount < 1000.0)`.

Below, we'll meet the <<aggregate-functions-orderedset,ordered set aggregate functions>>.

NOTE: Aggregate functions usually appear in the `select` clause, but control over aggregation is the responsibility of the `group by` clause, as described <<group-by,below>>.

[[aggregate-functions-collections]]
==== Aggregate functions and collections

The `elements()` and `indices()` functions we met <<elements-indices,earlier>> let us apply aggregate functions to a collection:

[cols="18,15,~,~"]
|===
| New syntax | Legacy HQL function ðŸ’€ | Applies to | Purpose

| `max(elements(x))` | `maxelement(x)` | Any collection with sortable elements | The maximum element or map value
| `min(elements(x))` | `minelement(x)` | Any collection with sortable elements | The minimum element or map value
| `sum(elements(x))` | â€” | Any collection with numeric elements | The sum of the elements or map values
| `avg(elements(x))` | â€” | Any collection with numeric elements | The average of the elements or map values
| `max(indices(x))` | `maxindex(x)` | Indexed collections (lists and maps) | The maximum list index or map key
| `min(indices(x))` | `minindex(x)` | Indexed collections (lists and maps) | The minimum list index or map key
| `sum(indices(x))` | â€” | Indexed collections (lists and maps) | The sum of the list indexes or map keys
| `avg(indices(x))` | â€” | Indexed collections (lists and maps) | The average of the list indexes or map keys
|===

These operations are mostly useful when working with ``@ElementCollection``s.

[[collection-expressions-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select title, max(indices(authors))+1, max(elements(editions)) from Book
----

[[aggregate-functions-filter]]
==== Aggregate functions with restriction

All aggregate functions support the inclusion of a _filter clause_, a sort of mini-`where` applying a restriction to just one item of the select list:

[[aggregate-functions-filter-example]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select
    year(item.order.dateTime) as year,
    sum(item.quantity) filter (where not item.order.fulfilled) as unfulfilled,
    sum(item.quantity) filter (where item.order.fulfilled) as fulfilled,
    sum(item.quantity * item.book.price) filter (where item.order.paid)
from Item as item
where item.book.isbn = :isbn
group by year(item.order.dateTime)
----

The BNF for the `filter` clause is simple:

[source,antlrv4]
----
filterClause
	: "FILTER" "(" "WHERE" predicate ")"
----

[[aggregate-functions-orderedset]]
==== Ordered set aggregate functions

An _ordered set aggregate function_ is a special aggregate function which has:

- not only an optional filter clause, as above, but also
- a `within group` clause containing a mini-`order by` specification.

The BNF for `within group` is straightforward:

[source,antlrv4]
----
withinGroupClause
	: "WITHIN" "GROUP" "(" "ORDER" "BY" sortSpecification ("," sortSpecification)* ")"
----

There are two main types of ordered set aggregate function:

- an _inverse distribution function_ calculates a value that characterizes the distribution of values within the group, for example, `percentile_cont(0.5)` is the median, and `percentile_cont(0.25)` is the lower quartile.
- a _hypothetical set function_ determines the position of a "hypothetical" value within the ordered set of values.

The following ordered set aggregate functions are available on many platforms:

[cols="30,~"]
|===
| Type | Functions

| Inverse distribution functions | `mode()`, `percentile_cont()`, `percentile_disc()`
| Hypothetical set functions | `rank()`, `dense_rank()`, `percent_rank()`, `cume_dist()`
| Other | `listagg()`
|===

This query calculates the median price of a book:

[source, hql]
----
select percentile_cont(0.5)
    within group (order by price)
from Book
----

This query finds the percentage of books with prices less than 10 dollars:

[source, hql]
----
select 100 * percent_rank(10.0)
    within group (order by price)
from Book
----

Actually, the most widely-supported ordered set aggregate function is one which builds a string by concatenating the values within a group.
This function has different names on different databases, but HQL abstracts these differences, andâ€”following ANSI SQLâ€”calls it `listagg()`.

[[aggregate-functions-within-group-example]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select listagg(title, ', ')
    within group (order by isbn)
from Book
group by element(authors)
----

This very useful function produces a string by concatenation of the aggregated values of its argument.

[[aggregate-functions-window]]
==== Window functions

A _window function_ is one which also has an `over` clause, for example:

[source,hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
select
    item.order.dateTime,
    sum(item.quantity)
        over (order by item.order.dateTime)
        as runningTotal
from Item item
----

This query returns a running total of sales over time.
That is, the `sum()` is taken over a window comprising the current row of the result set, together with all previous rows.

A window function application may optionally specify any of the following clauses:

[cols="23,18,~"]
|===
| Optional clause | Keyword | Purpose

| _Partitioning_ of the result set | `partition by` | Very similar to `group by`, but doesn't collapse each partition to a single row
| _Ordering_ of the partition | `order by` | Specifies the order of rows within a partition
| _Windowing_ | `range`, `rows`, or `groups` | Defines the bounds of a window frame within a partition
| _Restriction_ | `filter` | As aggregate functions, window functions may optionally specify a filter
|===

For example, we may partition the running total by book:

[source,hql]
----
select
    item.book.isbn,
    item.order.dateTime,
    sum(item.quantity)
        over (partition by item.book
              order by item.order.dateTime)
        as runningTotal
from Item item
----

Every partition runs in isolation, that is, rows can't leak across partitions.

The full syntax for window function application is amazingly involved, as shown by this BNF:

[source,antlrv4]
----
overClause
	: "OVER" "(" partitionClause? orderByClause? frameClause? ")"

partitionClause
	: "PARTITION" "BY" expression ("," expression)*

frameClause
	: ("RANGE"|"ROWS"|"GROUPS") frameStart frameExclusion?
	| ("RANGE"|"ROWS"|"GROUPS") "BETWEEN" frameStart "AND" frameEnd frameExclusion?

frameStart
	: "CURRENT" "ROW"
	| "UNBOUNDED" "PRECEDING"
	| expression "PRECEDING"
	| expression "FOLLOWING"

frameEnd
	: "CURRENT" "ROW"
	| "UNBOUNDED" "FOLLOWING"
	| expression "PRECEDING"
	| expression "FOLLOWING"

frameExclusion
	: "EXCLUDE" "CURRENT" "ROW"
	| "EXCLUDE" "GROUP"
	| "EXCLUDE" "TIES"
	| "EXCLUDE" "NO" "OTHERS"
----

Window functions are similar to aggregate functions in the sense that they compute some value based on a "frame" comprising multiple rows.
But unlike aggregate functions, window functions don't flatten rows within a window frame.

[discrete]
===== Window frames

The _window frame_ is the set of rows within a given partition that is passed to the window function.
There's a different window frame for each row of the result set.
In our example, the window frame comprised all the preceding rows within the partition, that is, all the rows with the same `item.book` and with an earlier `item.order.dateTime`.

The boundary of the window frame is controlled via the windowing clause, which may specify one of the following modes:

[cols="8,40,20,~"]
|===
| Mode | Definition | Example | Interpretation

|`rows` | Frame bounds defined by a given number of rows | `rows 5 preceding` | The previous 5 rows in the partition
| `groups` | Frame bounds defined by a given number of _peer groups_, rows belonging to the same peer group if they are assigned the same position by `order by` | `groups 5 preceding` | The rows in the previous 5 peer groups in the partition
| `range` | Frame bounds defined by a maximum difference in _value_ of the expression used to `order by` | `range between 1.0 preceding and 1.0 following` | The rows whose `order by` expression differs by a maximum absolute value of `1.0` from the current row
|===

The frame exclusion clause allows excluding rows around the current row:

[cols="20,~"]
|===
| Option | Interpretation

| `exclude current row` | Excludes the current row
| `exclude group` | Excludes rows of the peer group of the current row
| `exclude ties` | Excludes rows of the peer group of the current row except the current row
| `exclude no others` | The default, does not exclude anything
|===

By default, the window frame is defined as `rows between unbounded preceding and current row exclude no others`, meaning every row up to and including the current row.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The modes `range` and `groups`, along with frame exclusion modes, are not available on every database.
====
[discrete]
===== Widely supported window functions

The following window functions are available on all major platforms:

[cols="15,~,30"]
|===
| Window function | Purpose | Signature

| `row_number()` | The position of the current row within its frame | `row_number()`
| `lead()` | The value of a subsequent row in the frame | `lead(x)`, `lead(x, i, x)`
| `lag()` | The value of a previous row in the frame | `lag(x)`, `lag(x, i, x)`
| `first_value()` | The value of a first row in the frame | `first_value(x)`
| `last_value()` | The value of a last row in the frame | `last_value(x)`
| `nth_value()` | The value of the `n`th row in the frame | `nth_value(x, n)`
|===

In principle every aggregate or ordered set aggregate function might also be used as a window function, just by specifying `over`, but not every function is supported on every database.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Window functions and ordered set aggregate functions aren't available on every database.
Even where they are available, support for particular features varies widely between databases.
Therefore, we won't waste time going into further detail here.
For more information about the syntax and semantics of these functions, consult the documentation for your dialect of SQL.
====

[[set-operators]]
=== Operations on result sets

These operators apply not to expressions, but to entire result sets:

- `union` and `union all`,
- `intersect` and `intersect all`, and
- `except` and `except all`.

Just like in SQL, `all` suppresses the elimination of duplicate results.

[[union-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select nomDePlume from Author where nomDePlume is not null
union
select name from Person
----

[[order-by]]
=== Sorting

By default, the results of the query are returned in an arbitrary order.

[NOTE]
====
Imposing an order on a set is called _sorting_.

A relation (a database table) is a set, and therefore certain particularly dogmatic purists have argued that sorting has no place in the algebra of relations.
We think this is more than a bit silly: practical data analysis almost always involves sorting, which is a perfectly well-defined operation.
====

The `order by` clause specifies a list of projected items used to sort the results.
Each sorted item may be:

- an attribute of an entity or embeddable class,
- a more complex <<expressions,expression>>,
- the alias of a projected item declared in the select list, or
- a literal integer indicating the ordinal position of a projected item in the select list.

Of course, in principle, only certain types may be sorted: numeric types, string, and date and time types.
But HQL is very permissive here and will allow an expression of almost any type to occur in a sort list.
Even the identification variable of an entity with a sortable identifier type may occur as a sorted item.

[NOTE]
====
The JPQL specification requires that every sorted item in the `order by` clause also occur in the `select` clause.
HQL does not enforce this restriction, but applications desiring database portability should be aware that some databases _do_.

Therefore, you might wish to avoid the use of complex expressions in the sort list.
====

The BNF for a sorted item is:

[[order-by-item-bnf]]
[source, antlrv4]
----
include::{extrasdir}/order_by_item_bnf.txt[]
----

Each sorted item listed in the `order by` clause may explicitly specify a direction, either:

- `asc` for ascending order, or
- `desc` for descending order.

If no direction is explicitly specified, the results are returned in ascending order.

Of course, there's an ambiguity with respect to null values.
Therefore, the sorting of null values may be explicitly specified:

[cols="20,~"]
|===
| Precedence | Interpretation

| `nulls first` | Puts null values at the beginning of the result set
| `nulls last` | Puts them at the end
|===

[[order-by-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select title, publisher.name
from Book
order by title, publisher.name nulls last
----
[source, hql]
----
select book.isbn,
    year(order.dateTime) as year,
    sum(quantity) as yearlyTotalSold,
    sum(quantity * book.price) as yearlyTotalBilled
from Item
where book.isbn = :isbn
group by year(order.dateTime)
having year(order.dateTime) > 2000
   and sum(quantity) > 0
order by yearlyTotalSold desc, year desc
----

Queries with an ordered result list may have limits or pagination.

[[limit-offset]]
==== Limits and offsets

It's often useful to place a hard upper limit on the number of results that may be returned by a query.
The `limit` and `offset` clauses are an alternative to the use of `setMaxResults()` and `setFirstResult()` respectively,
and may similarly be used for pagination.

[TIP]
====
If the `limit` or `offset` is parameterized, it's much easier to use `setMaxResults()` or `setFirstResult()`.
====

The SQL `fetch` syntax is supported as an alternative:

[cols="25,45,~"]
|===
| Short form | Verbose form | Purpose

| `limit 10` | `fetch first 10 rows only` | Limit result set
| `limit 10 offset 20` | `offset 20 rows fetch next 10 rows only` | Paginate result set
|===

The BNF gets a bit complicated:

[[limit-offset-bnf]]
[source, antlrv4]
----
include::{extrasdir}/limit_offset_bnf.txt[]
----

These two queries are identical:

[[limit-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select title from Book
order by title, published desc
limit 50
----
[source, hql]
----
select title from Book
order by title, published desc
fetch first 50 rows only
----

These are well-defined limits: the number of results returned by the database will be limited to 50, as promised.
But not every query is quite so well-behaved.

[NOTE]
====
_Limiting_ certainly _isn't_ a well-defined relational operation, and must be used with care.

In particular, limits don't play well with <<explicit-fetch-join,fetch joins>>.
====

This next query is accepted by HQL, and no more than 50 results are returned by `getResultList()`, just as expected:

[[bad-limit-example]]
[source, hql]
----
select title from Book
    join fetch authors
order by title, published desc
limit 50
----
However, if you log the SQL executed by Hibernate, you'll notice something wrong:

[source, sql]
----
select
    b1_0.isbn,
    a1_0.books_isbn,
    a1_0.authors_ORDER,
    a1_1.id,
    a1_1.bio,
    a1_1.name,
    a1_1.person_id,
    b1_0.price,
    b1_0.published,
    b1_0.publisher_id,
    b1_0.title
from
    Book b1_0
join
    (Book_Author a1_0
        join
            Author a1_1
                on a1_1.id=a1_0.authors_id)
        on b1_0.isbn=a1_0.books_isbn
order by
    b1_0.title,
    b1_0.published desc
----

What happened to the `limit` clause?

[%unbreakable]
[IMPORTANT]
====
When limits or pagination are combined with a fetch join, Hibernate must retrieve all matching results from the database and _apply the limit in memory_!

This _almost certainly_ isn't the behavior you were hoping for, and in general will exhibit _terrible_ performance characteristics.
====

[[with-cte]]
=== Common table expressions

A _common table expression_ or CTE may be thought of as a sort of named subquery.
Any query with an uncorrelated subquery can in principle be rewritten so that the subquery occurs in the `with` clause.

But CTEs have capabilities that subqueries don't have.
The `with` clause lets us:

- specify materialization hints, and
- write recursive queries.

On databases which don't support CTEs natively, Hibernate attempts to rewrite any HQL query with CTEs as a SQL query with subqueries.
This is impossible for recursive queries, unfortunately.

Let's take a quick look at the BNF:

[source,antlrv4]
[%unbreakable]
----
withClause
	: "WITH" cte ("," cte)*

cte
	: identifier AS ("NOT"? "MATERIALIZED")? "(" queryExpression ")"
      searchClause? cycleClause?
----

The `with` clause comes right at the start of a query.
It may declare multiple CTEs with different names.

[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
with
    paid as (
        select ord.id as oid, sum(payment.amount) as amountPaid
        from Order as ord
            left join ord.payments as payment
        group by ord
        having local datetime - ord.dateTime < 365 day
    ),
    owed as (
        select ord.id as oid, sum(item.quantity*item.book.price) as amountOwed
        from Order as ord
            left join ord.items as item
        group by ord
        having local datetime - ord.dateTime < 365 day
    )
select id, paid.amountPaid, owed.amountOwed
from Order
where paid.amountPaid < owed.amountOwed
  and paid.oid = id and owed.oid = id
----

Notice that if we rewrote this query using subqueries, it would look quite a lot clumsier.

[[materialization-hints]]
==== Materialization hints

The `materialized` keyword is a hint to the database that the subquery should be separately executed and its results stored in a temporary table.

On the other hand, its nemesis, `not materialized`, is a hint that the subquery should be inlined at each use site, with each usage optimized independently.

[CAUTION]
====
The precise impact of materialization hints is quite platform-dependant.
====

Our example query from above hardly changes.
We just add `materialized` to the CTE declarations.

[[cte-materialized-example]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
with
    paid as materialized (
        select ord.id as oid, sum(payment.amount) as amountPaid
        from Order as ord
            left join ord.payments as payment
        group by ord
        having local datetime - ord.dateTime < 365 day
    ),
    owed as materialized (
        select ord.id as oid, sum(item.quantity*item.book.price) as amountOwed
        from Order as ord
            left join ord.items as item

[[recursive-queries]]
==== Recursive queries

A _recursive query_ is one where the CTE is defined self-referentially.
Recursive queries follow a very particular pattern.
The CTE is defined as a union of:

- a base subquery returning an initial set of rows where the recursion begins,
- a recursively-executed subquery which returns additional rows by joining against the CTE itself.

Let's demonstrate this with an example.

First we'll need some sort of tree-like entity:

[source,java]
[%unbreakable]
----
@Entity
class Node {
	@Id Long id;
	String text;
	@ManyToOne Node parent;
}
----

We may obtain a tree of ``Node``s with the following recursive query:

[[cte-recursive-example]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
with Tree as (
    /* base query */
    select root.id as id, root.text as text, 0 as level
        from Node root
        where root.parent is null
    union all
    /* recursion */
    select child.id as id, child.text as text, level+1 as level
        from Tree parent
        join Node child on child.parent.id = parent.id
)
select text, level
from Tree
----

When querying a tree-like of data structure, the base subquery usually returns the root node or nodes.
The recursively-executed subquery returns the children of the current set of nodes.
It's executed repeatedly with the results of the previous execution.
Recursion terminates when the recursively-executed subquery returns no new nodes.

[CAUTION]
====
Hibernate cannot emulate recursive queries on databases which don't support them natively.
====

Now, if a graph contains cycles, that is, if it isn't a tree, the recursion might never terminate.

==== Cycle detection

The `cycle` clause enables cycle detection, and aborts the recursion if a node is encountered twice.

[[cte-cycle-example]]
[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
with Tree as (
    /* base query */
    select root.id as id, root.text as text, 0 as level
        from Node root
        where root.parent is null
    union all
    /* recursion */
    select child.id as id, child.text as text, level+1 as level
        from Tree parent
        join Node child on child.parent.id = parent.id
) cycle id set abort to 'aborted!' default ''  /* cycle detection */
select text, level, abort
from Tree
order by level
----

Here:

- the `id` column is used to detect cycles, and
- the `abort` column is set to the string value `'aborted!'` if a cycle is detected.

Hibernate emulates the `cycle` clause on databases which don't support it natively.

The BNF for `cycle` is:

[[cte-recursive-cycle-bnf-example]]
[source, antlrv4]
[%unbreakable]
----
cycleClause
    : "CYCLE" identifier ("," identifier)*
      "SET" identifier ("TO" literal "DEFAULT" literal)?
      ("USING" identifier)?
----

The column optionally specified by `using` holds the path to the current row.

==== Ordering depth-first or breadth-first

The `search` clause allows us to control whether we would like the results of our query returned in an order that emulates a depth-first recursive search, or a breadth-first recursive search.

In our query above, we explicitly coded a `level` column that holds the recursion depth, and ordered our result set according to this depth.
With the `search` clause, that bookkeeping is already taken care of for us.

For depth-first search, we have:

[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
with Tree as (
    /* base query */
    select root.id as id, root.text as text
        from Node root
        where root.parent is null
    union all
    /* recursion */
    select child.id as id, child.text as text
        from Tree parent
        join Node child on child.parent.id = parent.id
) search depth first by id set level  /* depth-first search */
from Tree
select text
order by level
----

And for breadth-first search, we only need to change a single keyword:

[source, hql]
[%unbreakable]
----
with Tree as (
    /* base query */
    select root.id as id, root.text as text
        from Node root
        where root.parent is null
    union all
    /* recursion */
    select child.id as id, child.text as text
        from Tree parent
        join Node child on child.parent.id = parent.id
) search breadth first by id set level  /* breadth-first search */
from Tree
select text
order by level desc
----

Hibernate emulates the `search` clause on databases which don't support it natively.

The BNF for `search` is:

[[cte-recursive-search-bnf-example]]
[source, antlrv4]
[%unbreakable]
----
searchClause
    : "SEARCH" ("BREADTH"|"DEPTH") "FIRST"
      "BY" searchSpecifications
      "SET" identifier

searchSpecifications
    : searchSpecification ("," searchSpecification)*

searchSpecification
    : identifier sortDirection? nullsPrecedence?
