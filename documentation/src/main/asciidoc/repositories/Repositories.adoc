[[programming-model]]
== Programming model

Jakarta Data and Jakarta Persistence both represent data in a typesafe way, using _entity classes_.
Since Hibernate's implementation of Jakarta Data is backed by access to a relational database, these entity classes are mapped using the annotations defined by Jakarta Persistence.

For example:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Book {
    @Id
    String isbn;

    @Basic(optional = false)
    String title;

    LocalDate publicationDate;

    @Basic(optional = false)
    String text;

    @Enumerated(STRING)
    @Basic(optional = false)
    Type type = Type.Book;

    @ManyToOne(optional = false, fetch = LAZY)
    Publisher publisher;

    @ManyToMany(mappedBy = Author_.BOOKS)
    Set<Author> authors;

    ...
}

@Entity
public class Author {
    @Id
    String ssn;

    @Basic(optional = false)
    String name;

    Address address;

    @ManyToMany
    Set<Book> books;
}
----

For more information about mapping entities, see the link:{doc-introduction-url}#entities[Introduction to Hibernate 6].

[NOTE]
====
Jakarta Data also works with entities defined using similarly-named annotations defined by Jakarta NoSQL.
But in this document weâ€™re using Hibernate Data Repositories, so all mapping annotations should be understood to be the ones defined in `jakarta.persistence` or `org.hibernate.annotations`.
For more information about entities in Jakarta Data, please consult chapter 3 of the specification.
====

Furthermore, queries may be expressed in HQL, Hibernate's superset of the Jakarta Persistence Query Language (JPQL).

[NOTE]
====
The Jakarta Data specification defines a simple subset of JPQL called, appropriately, JDQL.
JDQL is mostly relevant to non-relational datastores; an implementation of Jakarta Data backed by access to relational data is normally expected to support a much larger subset of JPQL.
Indeed, Hibernate Data Repositories supports a _superset_ of JPQL.
So, even though we put rather a large amount of effort into advocating, designing, and specifying JDQL, we won't talk much about it here.
For information about JDQL, please consult chapter 5 of the Jakarta Data specification.
====

To learn more about HQL and JPQL, see the link:{doc-query-language-url}[Guide to Hibernate Query Language].

This is where the similarity between Jakarta Persistence and Jakarta Data ends.
The following table contrasts the two programming models.

[cols="25,^~,^~"]
|===
| | Persistence | Data

| Persistence contexts | Stateful | Stateless
| Gateway | `EntityManager` interface  | User-written `@Repository` interface
| Underlying implementation
| link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/Session.html[`Session`]
| link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/StatelessSession.html[`StatelessSession`]
| Persistence operations | Generic methods like `find()`, `persist()`, `merge()`, `remove()` | Typesafe user-written methods annotated `@Find`, `@Insert`, `@Update`, `@Save`, `@Delete`
| SQL execution | During flush | Immediate
| Updates | Usually implicit (dirty checking during flush) | Always explicit (by calling `@Update` method)
| Operation cascading | Depends on `CascadeType` | Never
| Lazy fetching | Implicit | Explicit using link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/StatelessSession.html#fetch(java.lang.Object)[`StatelessSession.fetch()`]
| Validation of JPQL | Runtime | Compile time
|===

The fundamental difference here is that Jakarta Data does not feature stateful persistence contexts.
Among other consequences:

- entity instances are always detached, and so
- updates require an explicit operation, and
- there's no transparent lazy association fetching.

It's important to understand that a repository in Hibernate Data Repositories is backed by a `StatelessSession`, not by a Jakarta Persistence `EntityManager`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
There's only one portable way to fetch an association in Jakarta Data, and that's by using a JPQL `join fetch` clause, in a <<query-method,`@Query` annotation>>.
The specification does not provide a portable way to fetch an association lazily.
To fetch an association, we need to <<stateless-fetch,call the `StatelessSession` directly>>.
This really isn't as bad as it sounds; overuse of lazy fetching is associated with poor performance due to many round trips to the database server.
====

[NOTE]
====
A future release of Jakarta Data will feature repositories backed by Jakarta Persistence stateful persistence contexts, but this functionality did not make the cut for Jakarta Data 1.0.
====

The second big difference is that instead of providing a generic interface like `EntityManager` that's capable of performing persistence operations for any entity class, Jakarta Data requires that each interaction with the database go via a user-written method specific to just one entity type. The method is marked with annotations allowing Hibernate to fill in the method implementation.

For example, whereas Jakarta Persistence defines the methods `find()` and `persist()` of `EntityManager`, in Jakarta Data the application programmer is required to write an interface like the following:

[source,java]
----
@Repository
interface Library {
    @Find
    Book book(String isbn);

    @Insert
    void add(Book book);
}
----

This is our first example of a repository.

[[repository-interfaces]]
=== Repository interfaces

A _repository interface_ is an interface written by you, the application programmer, and annotated `@Repository`.
The implementation of the repository interface is provided by a Jakarta Data provider, in our case, by Hibernate Data Repositories.

The Jakarta Data specification does not say how this should work, but in Hibernate Data Repositories, the implementation is generated by an annotation processor.
In fact, you might already be using this annotation processor: it's just `HibernateProcessor` from the  module which used to be called `hibernate-jpamodelgen`, and has now been renamed `hibernate-processor` in Hibernate 7.

[TIP]
====
That's right, this fancy thing I'm calling Hibernate Data Repositories is really just a new feature of Hibernate's venerable static metamodel generator.
If you're already using the JPA static metamodel in your project, you already have Jakarta Data at your fingertips.
If you don't, we'll see how to set it up in the <<configuration-integration,next chapter>>.
====

Of course, a Jakarta Data provider can't generate an implementation of any arbitrary method.
Therefore, the methods of a repository interface must fall into one of the following categories:

- <<default-method,`default` methods>>,
- <<lifecycle-method,_lifecycle methods_>> annotated `@Insert`, `@Update`, `@Delete`, or `@Save`,
- <<find-method,_automatic query methods_>> annotated `@Find`,
- <<query-method,_annotated query methods_>> annotated `@Query` or `@SQL`, and
- <<resource-accessor-method,_resource accessor methods_>>.

[TIP]
====
For users migrating from Spring Data, Jakarta Data also provides a _Query by Method Name_ facility.
We don't recommend this approach for new code, since it leads to extremely verbose and unnatural method names for anything but the most trivial examples.
====

We'll discuss each of these kinds of method soon.
But first we need to ask a more basic question: how are persistence operations organized into repositories, and how do repository interfaces relate to entity types?
The--perhaps surprising--answer is: it's completely up to you.

[[organizing-repository-operations]]
=== Organizing persistence operations

Jakarta Data lets you freely assign persistence operations to repositories according to your own preference.
In particular, Jakarta Data does not require that a repository interface inherit a built-in supertype declaring the basic "CRUD" operations, and so it's not necessary to have a separate repository interface for each entity.
You're permitted, for example, to have a single `Library` interface instead of `BookRepository`, `AuthorRepository`, and `PublisherRepository`.

Thus, the whole programming model is much more flexible than older approaches such as Spring Data, which require a repository interface per entity class, or, at least, per so-called "aggregate".

[WARNING]
====
The concept of an "aggregate" makes sense in something like a document database.
But relational data does not have aggregates, and you should avoid attempting to shoehorn your relational tables into this inappropriate way of thinking about data.
====

As a convenience, especially for users migrating from older frameworks, Jakarta Data does define the `BasicRepository` and `CrudRepository` interfaces, and you can use them if you like.
But in Jakarta Data there's not much special about these interfaces; their operations are declared using the same annotations you'll use to declare methods of your own repositories.
This older, less-flexible approach is illustrated in the following example.

[source,java]
----
// old way

@Repository
interface BookRepository
        extends CrudRepository<Book,String> {
    // query methods
    ...
}

@Repository
interface AuthorRepository
        extends CrudRepository<Author,String> {
    // query methods
    ...
}
----

We won't see `BasicRepository` and `CrudRepository` again in this document, because they're not necessary, and because they implement the older, less-flexible way of doing things.

Instead, our repositories will often group together operations dealing with several related entities, even when the entities don't have a single "root".
This situation is _extremely_ common in relational data models.
In our example, `Book` and `Author` are related by a `@ManyToMany` association, and are both "roots".

[source,java]
----
// new way

@Repository
interface Publishing {
    @Find
    Book book(String isbn);

    @Find
    Author author(String ssn);

    @Insert
    void publish(Book book);

    @Insert
    void create(Author author);

    // query methods
    ...
}
----

Now let's walk through the different kinds of method that a repository interface might declare, beginning with the easiest kind.
If the following summary is insufficient, you'll find more detailed information about repositories in chapter 4 of the Jakarta Data specification, and in the Javadoc of the relevant annotations.


[[default-method]]
=== Default methods

A `default` method is one you implement yourself, and there's nothing special about it.

[source,java]
----
@Repository
interface Library {
    default void hello() {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
----

This doesn't look very useful, at least not unless there's some way to interact with the database from a `default` method.
For that, we'll need to add a resource accessor method.

[[resource-accessor-method]]
=== Resource accessor methods

A resource accessor method is one which exposes access to an underlying implementation type.
Currently, Hibernate Data Repositories only supports one such type: `StatelessSession`.
So a resource accessor method is just any abstract method which returns `StatelessSession`.
The name of the method doesn't matter.

[source,java]
----
StatelessSession session();
----

This method returns the `StatelessSession` backing the repository.

[TIP]
====
Usually, a resource accessor method is called from a `default` method of the same repository.
[source,java]
----
default void refresh(Book book) {
    session().refresh(book);
}
----
This is very useful when we need to gain direct access to the `StatelessSession` in order to take advantage of the full power of Hibernate.
====

[[stateless-fetch]]
[TIP]
====
A resource accessor method is also useful when we need to lazily fetch an association.
[source,java]
----
library.session().fetch(book.authors);
----
====

Usually, of course, we want Jakarta Data to take care of interacting with the `StatelessSession`.

[[lifecycle-method]]
=== Lifecycle methods

Jakarta Data 1.0 defines four built-in lifecycle annotations, which map perfectly to the basic operations of the Hibernate `StatelessSession`:

- `@Insert` maps to `insert()`,
- `@Update` maps to `update()`,
- `@Delete` maps to `delete()`, and
- `@Save` maps to `upsert()`.

[NOTE]
The basic operations of `StatelessSession` -- `insert()`, `update()`, `delete()`, and `upsert()` -- do not have matching ``CascadeType``s, and so these operations are never cascaded to associated entities.

A lifecycle method usually accepts an instance of an entity type, and is usually declared `void`.

[source,java]
----
@Insert
void add(Book book);
----

Alternatively, it may accept a list or array of entities.
(A variadic parameter is considered an array.)

[source,java]
----
@Insert
void add(Book... books);
----

[NOTE]
====
A future release of Jakarta Data might expand the list of built-in lifecycle annotations.
In particular, we're hoping to add `@Persist`, `@Merge`, `@Refresh`, `@Lock`, and `@Remove`, mapping to the fundamental operations of `EntityManager`.
====

Repositories wouldn't be useful at all if this was all they could do.
Jakarta Data really starts to shine when we start to use it to express queries.

[[find-method]]
=== Automatic query methods

An automatic query method is usually annotated `@Find`.
The simplest automatic query method is one which retrieves an entity instance by its unique identifier.

[source,java]
----
@Find
Book book(String isbn);
----

The name of the parameter identifies that this is a lookup by primary key (the `isbn` field is annotated `@Id` in `Book`) and so this method will be implemented to call the `get()` method of `StatelessSession`.

[NOTE]
====
If the parameter name does not match any field of the returned entity type, or if the type of the parameter does not match the type of the matching field, `HibernateProcessor` reports a helpful error at compilation time.
This is our first glimpse of the advantages of using Jakarta Data repositories with Hibernate.
====

If there is no `Book` with the given `isbn` in the database, the method throws `EmptyResultException`.
There's two ways around this if that's not what we want:

- declare the method to return `Optional`, or
- annotate the method `@jakarta.annotation.Nullable`.

The first option is blessed by the specification:

[source,java]
----
@Find
Optional<Book> book(String isbn);
----

The second option is an extension provided by Hibernate:

[source,java]
----
@Find @Nullable
Book book(String isbn);
----

An automatic query method might return multiple results.
In this case, the return type must be an array or list of the entity type.

[source,java]
----
@Find
List<Book> book(String title);
----

Usually, arguments to a parameter of an automatic query method must match _exactly_ with the field of an entity.
However, Hibernate provides the link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/annotations/processing/Pattern.html[`@Pattern`] annotation to allow for "fuzzy" matching using `like`.

[source,java]
----
@Find
List<Book> books(@Pattern String title);
----

Furthermore, if the parameter type is a list or array of the entity field type, the resulting query has an `in` condition.

[source,java]
----
@Find
List<Book> books(String[] ibsn);
----

Or course, an automatic query method might have multiple parameters.

[source,java]
----
@Find
List<Book> book(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished);
----

In this case, _every_ argument must match the corresponding field of the entity.

The `_` character in a parameter name may be used to navigate associations:

[source,java]
----
@Find
List<Book> booksPublishedBy(String publisher_name);
----

However, once our query starts to involve multiple entities, it's usually better to use an <<query-method,annotated query method>>.

The `@OrderBy` annotation allows results to be sorted.

[source,java]
----
@Find
@OrderBy("title")
@OrderBy("publisher.name")
List<Book> book(@Pattern String title, Year yearPublished);
----

This might not look very typesafe at first glance, but--amazingly--the content of the `@OrderBy` annotation is completely validated at compile time, as we will see below.

Automatic query methods are great and convenient for very simple queries.
For anything that's not extremely simple, we're much better off writing a query in JPQL.

[[query-method]]
=== Annotated query methods

An annotated query method is declared using:

- `@Query` from Jakarta Data, or
- link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/annotations/processing/HQL.html[`@HQL`] or link:{doc-javadoc-url}org/hibernate/annotations/processing/SQL.html[`@SQL`] from `org.hibernate.annotations.processing`.

The `@Query` annotation is defined to accept JPQL, JDQL, or anything in between.
In Hibernate Data Repositories, it accepts arbitrary HQL.

[NOTE]
====
There's no strong reason to use `@HQL` in preference to `@Query`.
This annotation exists because the functionality described here predates the existence of Jakarta Data.
====

Consider the following example:

[source,java]
----
@Query("where title like :pattern order by title, isbn")
List<Book> booksByTitle(String pattern);
----

You might notice that:

- The `from` clause is not required in JDQL, and is inferred from the return type of the repository method.
- Since Jakarta Persistence 3.2, neither the `select` cause nor entity aliases (identification variables) are required in JPQL, finally standardizing a very old feature of HQL.

This allows simple queries to be written in a very compact form.

Method parameters are automatically matched to ordinal or named parameters of the query.
In the previous example, `pattern` matches `:pattern`.
In the following variation, the first method parameter matches `?1`.

[source,java]
----
@Query("where title like ?1 order by title, isbn")
List<Book> booksByTitle(String pattern);
----

You might be imagining that the JPQL query specified within the `@Query` annotation cannot be validated at compile time, but this is not the case.
`HibernateProcessor` is not only capable of validating the _syntax_ of the query, but it even _typechecks_ the query completely.
This is much better than passing a string to the `createQuery()` method of `EntityManager`, and it's probably the top reason to use Jakarta Data with Hibernate.

When a query returns more than one object, the nicest thing to do is package each result as an instance of a Java `record` type.
For example, we might define a `record` holding some fields of `Book` and `Author`.

[source,java]
----
record AuthorBookSummary(String isbn, String ssn, String authorName, String title) {}
----

We need to specify that the values in the `select` clause should be packaged as instances of `AuthorBookSummary`.
The JPQL specification provides the `select new` construct for this.

[source,java]
----
@Query("select new AuthorBookSummary(b.isbn, a.ssn, a.name, b.title " +
       "from Author a join books b " +
       "where title like :pattern")
List<AuthorBookSummary> summariesForTitle(@Pattern String pattern);
----

Note that the `from` clause is required here, since it's impossible to infer the queried entity type from the return type of the repository method.

[TIP]
====
Since this is quite verbose, Hibernate doesn't require the use of `select new`, nor of aliases, and lets us write:
[source,java]
----
@Query("select isbn, ssn, name, title " +
       "from Author join books " +
       "where title like :pattern")
List<AuthorBookSummary> summariesForTitle(@Pattern String pattern);
----
====

An annotated query method may even perform an `update`, `delete`, or `insert` statement.

[source,java]
----
@Query("delete from Book " +
       "where extract(year from publicationDate) < :year")
int deleteOldBooks(int year);

----

The method must be declared `void`, or return `int` or `long`.
The return value is the number of affected records.

Finally, a native SQL query may be specified using `@SQL`.

[source,java]
----
@SQL("select title from books where title like :pattern order by title, isbn")
List<String> booksByTitle(String pattern);
----

Unfortunately, native SQL queries cannot be validated at compile time, so if there's anything wrong with our SQL, we won't find out until we run our program.

[[by-and-param]]
=== `@By` and `@Param`

Query methods match method parameters to entity fields or query parameters by name.
Occasionally, this is inconvenient, resulting in less natural method parameter names.
Let's reconsider an example we already saw above:

[source,java]
----
@Find
List<Book> books(String[] ibsn);
----

Here, because the parameter name must match the field `isbn` of `Book`, we couldn't call it `isbns`, plural.

The `@By` annotation lets us work around this problem:

[source,java]
----
@Find
List<Book> books(@By("isbn") String[] ibsns);
----

Naturally, the name and type of the parameter are still checked at compile time; there's no loss of typesafety here, despite the string.

The `@Param` annotation is significantly less useful, since we can always rename our HQL query parameter to match the method parameter, or, at worst, use an ordinal parameter instead.
