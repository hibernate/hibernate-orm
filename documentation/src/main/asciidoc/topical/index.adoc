[[support]]
== Compatibility and Support

Compatibility is defined as ...

Support is defined as ...

By default, all parts of Hibernate are considered supported and follow the general backwards compatibility https://hibernate.org/community/compatibility-policy/[policy].
Various things influence the levels of support and backwards compatibility to expect in regard to parts of Hibernate.

[[support-internal]]
=== Internal

Internal parts of Hibernate are simply that - internal implementation details that are not supported for use by applications.
Use of internal contracts should be avoided as they are not supported and could be removed or changed at any time.

Contracts considered internal are defined in one of 2 ways:

1. The Java class (interface, etc.) is defined under a package named `internal`, either directly or as a sub-package
2. Through the use of the `@Internal` annotation.

See the definitive set of link:{report-internals-url}[internals].


[[support-incubating]]
=== Incubating

Incubating contracts are generally new contracts which are still being actively designed, similar to
"tech preview" features.
Such contracts are subject to change and should be used with that understanding.

See the definitive set of link:{report-incubating-url}[incubations].

[[support-deprecation]]
=== Deprecations

1. `@Deprecated`
2. `@Remove`

See the definitive set of link:{report-deprecation-url}[deprecations].
