== Preface

Working with both Object-Oriented software and Relational Databases can be cumbersome and time-consuming.
Development costs are significantly higher due to a paradigm mismatch between how data is represented in objects versus relational databases.
Hibernate is an Object/Relational Mapping solution for Java environments.
The term https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping[Object/Relational Mapping] refers to the technique of mapping data from an object model representation to a relational data model representation (and vice versa).

Hibernate not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities.
It can significantly reduce development time otherwise spent with manual data handling in SQL and JDBC.
Hibernateâ€™s design goal is to relieve the developer from 95% of common data persistence-related programming tasks by eliminating the need for manual, hand-crafted data processing using SQL and JDBC.
However, unlike many other persistence solutions, Hibernate does not hide the power of SQL from you and guarantees that your investment in relational technology and knowledge is as valid as always.

Hibernate may not be the best solution for data-centric applications that only use stored-procedures to implement the business logic in the database, it is most useful with object-oriented domain models and business logic in the Java-based middle-tier.
However, Hibernate can certainly help you to remove or encapsulate vendor-specific SQL code and will help with the common task of result set translation from a tabular representation to a graph of objects.

[TIP]
====
New users may want to first look at the tutorial-style link:{doc-quick-start-url}[Quick Start] guide.

This User Guide is really more of a reference guide.
For a more high-level discussion of the most used features of Hibernate, see the link:{doc-introduction-url}[Introduction to Hibernate] guide.

There is also a series of link:{doc-topical-url}[topical guides] providing deep dives into various topics such as logging, compatibility and support, etc.
