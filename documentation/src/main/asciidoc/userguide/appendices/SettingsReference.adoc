== Configuration Settings

Configuration settings can be broadly broken down into 3 categories -

Jakarta Persistence::
    Settings which are standardized by the Jakarta Persistence specification for configuring any persistence provider.  These
    settings are defined by the `jakarta.persistence.` namespace
Hibernate::
    Hibernate-specific settings which control various Hibernate behaviors which are extensions to or outside the scope
    of the Jakarta Persistence specification.  These settings are defined by the `hibernate.` namespace
Legacy JPA::
    Settings which were standardized by Java Persistence, the legacy version of the Jakarta Persistence specification
    (prior to version 3.1).  These settings are defined by the `javax.persistence.` namespace

[NOTE]
====
For the time being, Hibernate continues to support the legacy Java Persistence settings in addition to
the Jakarta Persistence forms.  Applications should strongly consider migrating to the new Jakarta Persistence
as support for the legacy Java Persistence will likely be removed at some point.

For (legacy) Hibernate settings which have a direct Jakarta Persistence corollary, the Jakarta Persistence
form should be preferred - e.g. `hibernate.connection.driver_class` -> `jakarta.persistence.jdbc.driver`.
