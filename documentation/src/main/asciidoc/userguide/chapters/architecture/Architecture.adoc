Hibernate, as an ORM solution, effectively "sits between" the Java application data access layer and the Relational Database, as can be seen in the diagram above.
The Java application makes use of the Hibernate APIs to load, store, query, etc. its domain data.
Here we will introduce the essential Hibernate APIs.
This will be a brief introduction; we will discuss these contracts in detail later.

As a Jakarta Persistence provider, Hibernate implements the Java Persistence API specifications and the association between Jakarta Persistence interfaces and Hibernate specific implementations can be visualized in the following diagram:

SessionFactory (`org.hibernate.SessionFactory`):: A thread-safe (and immutable) representation of the mapping of the application domain model to a database.
Acts as a factory for `org.hibernate.Session` instances. The `EntityManagerFactory` is the Jakarta Persistence equivalent of a `SessionFactory` and basically, those two converge into the same `SessionFactory` implementation.
+
A `SessionFactory` is very expensive to create, so, for any given database, the application should have only one associated `SessionFactory`.
The `SessionFactory` maintains services that Hibernate uses across all `Session(s)` such as second level caches, connection pools, transaction system integrations, etc.

Session (`org.hibernate.Session`):: A single-threaded, short-lived object conceptually modeling a "Unit of Work" (<<Bibliography.adoc#PoEAA,PoEAA>>).
In Jakarta Persistence nomenclature, the `Session` is represented by an `EntityManager`.
+
Behind the scenes, the Hibernate `Session` wraps a JDBC `java.sql.Connection` and acts as a factory for `org.hibernate.Transaction` instances.
It maintains a generally "repeatable read" persistence context (first level cache) of the application domain model.

Transaction (`org.hibernate.Transaction`):: A single-threaded, short-lived object used by the application to demarcate individual physical transaction boundaries.
`EntityTransaction` is the Jakarta Persistence equivalent and both act as an abstraction API to isolate the application from the underlying transaction system in use (JDBC or JTA).
