=== JDBC batching

JDBC offers support for batching together SQL statements that can be represented as a single PreparedStatement.
Implementation wise this generally means that drivers will send the batched operation to the server in one call,
which can save on network calls to the database. Hibernate can leverage JDBC batching.
The following settings control this behavior.

`hibernate.jdbc.batch_size`::
	Controls the maximum number of statements Hibernate will batch together before asking the driver to execute the batch.
	Zero or a negative number disables this feature.

`hibernate.jdbc.batch.builder`::
	Names the implementation class used to manage batching capabilities.
	It is almost never a good idea to switch from Hibernate's default implementation.
	But if you wish to, this setting would name the `org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.batch.spi.BatchBuilder` implementation to use.

`hibernate.order_updates`::
	Forces Hibernate to order SQL updates by the entity type and the primary key value of the items being updated.
	This allows for more batching to be used. It will also result in fewer transaction deadlocks in highly concurrent systems.
	Comes with a performance hit, so benchmark before and after to see if this actually helps or hurts your application.

`hibernate.order_inserts`::
	Forces Hibernate to order inserts to allow for more batching to be used.
	Comes with a performance hit, so benchmark before and after to see if this actually helps or hurts your application.

[NOTE]
====
Since version 5.2, Hibernate allows overriding the global JDBC batch size given by the `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` configuration property on a per `Session` basis.

=== Session batching

The following example shows an anti-pattern for batch inserts.

[[batch-session-batch-example]]
.Naive way to insert 100 000 entities with Hibernate
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-doc-batch}/BatchTests.java[tags=batch-session-batch-example]
----
====

There are several problems associated with this example:

. Hibernate caches all the newly inserted `Person` instances in the session-level cache, so, when the transaction ends, 100 000 entities are managed by the persistence context.
  If the maximum memory allocated to the JVM is rather low, this example could fail with an `OutOfMemoryException`.
  The Java 1.8 JVM allocated either 1/4 of available RAM or 1Gb, which can easily accommodate 100 000 objects on the heap.
. long-running transactions can deplete a connection pool so other transactions don't get a chance to proceed.
. JDBC batching is not enabled by default, so every insert statement requires a database round trip.
  To enable JDBC batching, set the `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` property to an integer between 10 and 50.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Hibernate disables insert batching at the JDBC level transparently if you use an identity identifier generator.
====

[[batch-session-batch-insert]]
==== Batch inserts

When you make new objects persistent, employ methods `flush()` and `clear()` to the session regularly, to control the size of the first-level cache.

[[batch-session-scroll]]
==== Session scroll

When you retrieve and update data, `flush()` and `clear()` the session regularly.
In addition, use method `scroll()` to take advantage of server-side cursors for queries that return many rows of data.

.Using `scroll()`
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-doc-batch}/BatchTests.java[tags=batch-session-scroll-example]
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
If left unclosed by the application, Hibernate will automatically close the underlying resources (e.g. `ResultSet` and `PreparedStatement`) used internally by the `ScrollableResults` when the current transaction is ended (either commit or rollback).

However, it is good practice to close the `ScrollableResults` explicitly.
====

==== StatelessSession

`StatelessSession` is an alternative to `Session` and provides:

- a command-oriented API
- with no associated persistence context.

Thus, a stateless session is a slightly lower-level abstraction that's closer to the underlying JDBC activity:

* there's no first-level cache, and
* there's no transactional write-behind or automatic dirty checking.

Instead, persistence operations occur synchronously when a method of `StatelessSession` is invoked, and entities returned by a stateless session are always detached.

[TIP]
====
A stateless session may be used to stream data to and from the database in the form of detached objects.
With a stateless session, there's no need to explicitly manage the size of the first-level cache by explicitly clearing the persistence context.
====

The `StatelessSession` API comes with certain limitations:

* operations performed using a stateless session never cascade to associated instances,
* lazy loading of associations is not transparent, and is only available via an explicit operation named `fetch()`, and
* operations performed via a stateless session bypass Hibernate's event model and action queue.

IMPORTANT: Due to the lack of a first-level cache, stateless sessions are vulnerable to data aliasing effects.

.Using a  `StatelessSession`
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-doc-batch}/BatchTests.java[tags=batch-stateless-session-example]
----
====

The `Person` instances returned by the query are immediately detached.
They are never associated with any persistence context.

[NOTE]
====
The `insert()`, `update()`, and `delete()` operations defined by the `StatelessSession` interface operate directly on database rows.
They cause the corresponding SQL operations to be executed immediately.
They have different semantics from the `save()`, `saveOrUpdate()`, and `delete()` operations defined by the `Session` interface.

[[batch-bulk-hql]]
=== Hibernate Query Language for DML

DML, or Data Manipulation Language, refers to SQL statements such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
Hibernate provides methods for bulk SQL-style DML statement execution, in the form of Hibernate Query Language (HQL).

[[batch-bulk-hql-update-delete]]
==== HQL/JPQL for UPDATE and DELETE

Both the Hibernate native Query Language and JPQL (Java Persistence Query Language) provide support for bulk UPDATE and DELETE.

[[batch-bulk-hql-update-delete-example]]
.Pseudo-syntax for UPDATE and DELETE statements using HQL
====
[source, sql, indent=0]
----
UPDATE FROM EntityName e WHERE e.name = ?

DELETE FROM EntityName e WHERE e.name = ?
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Although the `FROM` and `WHERE` clauses are optional, it is good practice to declare them explicitly.
====

The `FROM` clause can only refer to a single entity, which can be aliased.
If the entity name is aliased, any property references must be qualified using that alias.
If the entity name is not aliased, then it is illegal for any property references to be qualified.

[NOTE]
====
Joins, either implicit or explicit, are prohibited in a bulk HQL query.
You can use sub-queries in the `WHERE` clause, and the sub-queries themselves can contain joins.

----
include::{example-dir-doc-batch}/BatchTests.java[tags=batch-bulk-hql-update-example]
----
====

In keeping with the EJB3 specification, HQL `UPDATE` statements, by default, do not effect the version or the timestamp property values for the affected entities.
You can use a versioned update to force Hibernate to reset the version or timestamp property values, by adding the `VERSIONED` keyword after the `UPDATE` keyword.

----
include::{example-dir-doc-batch}/BatchTests.java[tags=batch-bulk-hql-update-version-example]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
If you use the `VERSIONED` statement, you cannot use custom version types that implement the `org.hibernate.usertype.UserVersionType`.

This feature is only available in HQL since it's not standardized by Jakarta Persistence.

.An HQL `DELETE` statement
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-doc-batch}/BatchTests.java[tags=batch-bulk-hql-delete-example]
----
====

Method `Query.executeUpdate()` returns an `int` value, which indicates the number of entities affected by the operation.
This may or may not correlate to the number of rows affected in the database.
A JPQL/HQL bulk operation might result in multiple SQL statements being executed, such as for joined-subclass.
In the example of joined-subclass, a `DELETE` against one of the subclasses may actually result in deletes in the tables underlying the join, or further down the inheritance hierarchy.

==== HQL syntax for INSERT

.Pseudo-syntax for INSERT-SELECT statements
====
[source, sql, indent=0]
----
INSERT INTO EntityName
	properties_list
SELECT select_list
FROM ...
----
====

Alternatively one can also declare individual values

.Pseudo-syntax for INSERT-VALUES statements
====
[source, sql, indent=0]
----
INSERT INTO EntityName
	properties_list
VALUES values_list
----
====

The `properties_list` is analogous to the column specification in the `SQL` `INSERT` statement.
Note that `INSERT` statements are inherently non-polymorphic, so it is not possible to use an `EntityName`
which is abstract or refer to subclass properties.

The SELECT statement can be any valid HQL select query, but the return types must match the types expected by the INSERT.
Hibernate verifies the return types during query compilation, instead of expecting the database to check it.
Problems might result from Hibernate types which are equivalent, rather than equal.
One such example is a mismatch between a property defined as an `org.hibernate.type.StandardBasicTypes.DATE` and a property defined as an `org.hibernate.type.StandardBasicTypes.TIMESTAMP`,
even though the database may not make a distinction, or may be capable of handling the conversion.

If id property is not specified in the `properties_list`, Hibernate generates a value automatically.
Automatic generation is only available if you use ID generators which operate on the database.
Otherwise, Hibernate throws an exception during parsing.  Available in-database generators implement
`org.hibernate.id.PostInsertIdentifierGenerator`.

For properties mapped as either version or timestamp, the insert statement gives you two options.
You can either specify the property in the properties_list, in which case its value is taken from the corresponding select expressions or omit it from the properties_list,
in which case the seed value defined by the `org.hibernate.type.descriptor.java.VersionJavaType` is used.

[[batch-bulk-hql-strategies]]
==== Bulk mutation strategies

When a bulk mutation involves multiple tables, Hibernate has to issue individual DML statements to the respective tables.
Since the mutation itself could have an effect on the conditions used in the statement, it's generally not possible
to simply execute parts of the DML statement against the respective tables. Instead, Hibernate has to temporarily remember
which rows will be affected, and execute the DML statements based on these rows.

Usually, Hibernate will make use of local or global temporary tables to remember the primary keys of the rows.
For some databases, currently only PostgreSQL and DB2, a more advanced strategy (`CteMutationStrategy`) is used,
which makes use of DML in CTE support to execute the whole operation in one SQL statement.

The chosen strategy, unless overridden through the `hibernate.query.mutation_strategy` setting, is based on the
Dialect support through `org.hibernate.dialect.Dialect.getFallbackSqmMutationStrategy`.

`HT_Person` is a temporary table that Hibernate creates to hold all the entity identifiers that are to be updated or deleted by the bulk operation.
The temporary table can be either global or local, depending on the underlying database capabilities.

[[batch-bulk-hql-strategies-non-temporary-table]]
===== Non-temporary table bulk mutation strategies

The strategies outlined above depend on the creation of temporary tables, which Hibernate creates on startup if they don't already exist. At present this process is not integrated in the schema management tooling, and this requires that the user have the required permissions to alter the database schema.

If the Hibernate session user lacks these permissions, you will need to either:

 * alter your schema through a different user with more permissions, to add a global temporary table named HTE_<root entity table name>, which contains all columns of all tables involved in the entity hierarchy. +
This will allow insert, update and delete in HQL for multi-table entities.

* OR configure Hibernate ORM to use the (badly-performing) inline strategy (for _mutations_ only!):

[source,xml]
----
<property name="hibernate.query.mutation_strategy"
          value="org.hibernate.query.sqm.mutation.internal.inline.InlineMutationStrategy"
/>
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
We strongly recommend the use of the first option, i.e. manually adding the temporary tables, because the inline strategy is set to be removed in a future release. Also, there is no equivalent strategy for inserts.

Additionally, automatic creation of temporary tables should be deactivated. This is done by setting the

`hibernate.query.mutation_strategy.global_temporary.create_tables` and `hibernate.query.mutation_strategy.global_temporary.drop_tables`

*or*

`hibernate.query.mutation_strategy.persistent.create_tables` and `hibernate.query.mutation_strategy.persistent.drop_tables`

properties (depending on the default strategy for the dialect) to `false`
====

With the inline strategy, when running the previous test case, Hibernate generates the following SQL statements:

[[batch-bulk-hql-InlineIdsInClauseBulkIdStrategy-delete-query-example]]
.`InlineIdsInClauseBulkIdStrategy` delete entity query example
====
[source, sql, indent=0]
----
include::{extrasdir}/batch-bulk-hql-InlineIdsInClauseBulkIdStrategy-delete-query-example.sql[]
----
====

So, the entity identifiers are selected first and used for each particular update or delete statement.
