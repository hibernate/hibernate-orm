At runtime, Hibernate handles moving data into and out of the second-level cache in response to the operations performed by the `Session`, which acts as a transaction-level cache of persistent data.
Once an entity becomes managed, that object is added to the internal cache of the current persistence context (`EntityManager` or `Session`).
The persistence context is also called the first-level cache, and it's enabled by default.

It is possible to configure a JVM-level (`SessionFactory`-level) or even a cluster cache on a class-by-class and collection-by-collection basis.

[NOTE]
====
Be aware that Hibernate caches are not aware of changes made to the persistent store by other applications.

To address this limitation, you can configure a TTL (Time To Live) retention policy at the second-level cache region level so that the underlying cache entries expire regularly.
====

[[caching-config]]
=== Configuring second-level caching

Hibernate can integrate with various caching providers for the purpose of caching data outside the context of a particular `Session`.
This section defines the settings which control this behavior.

[[caching-config-provider]]
==== RegionFactory

`org.hibernate.cache.spi.RegionFactory` defines the integration between Hibernate and a pluggable caching provider.
`hibernate.cache.region.factory_class` is used to declare the provider to use.
Hibernate comes with built-in support for the Java caching standard <<caching-provider-jcache,JCache>>
and also the popular caching library: <<caching-provider-infinispan,Infinispan>>.
Detailed information is provided later in this chapter.

[[caching-config-properties]]
==== Caching configuration properties

Besides provider specific configuration, there are a number of configurations options on the Hibernate side of the integration that control various caching behaviors:

`hibernate.cache.use_second_level_cache`::
	Enable or disable second level caching overall. By default, if the currently configured
	https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/cache/spi/RegionFactory.html[`RegionFactory`] is not the `NoCachingRegionFactory`, then the second-level cache is going to be enabled. Otherwise, the second-level cache is disabled.
`hibernate.cache.use_query_cache`::
	Enable or disable second level caching of query results. The default is false.
`hibernate.cache.query_cache_factory`::
	Query result caching is handled by a special contract that deals with staleness-based invalidation of the results.
	The default implementation does not allow stale results at all. Use this for applications that would like to relax that.
	Names an implementation of `org.hibernate.cache.spi.TimestampsCacheFactory`.
`hibernate.cache.use_minimal_puts`::
	Optimizes second-level cache operations to minimize writes, at the cost of more frequent reads. Providers typically set this appropriately.
`hibernate.cache.region_prefix`::
	Defines a name to be used as a prefix to all second-level cache region names.
`hibernate.cache.default_cache_concurrency_strategy`::
	In Hibernate second-level caching, all regions can be configured differently including the concurrency strategy to use when accessing that particular region.
	This setting allows defining a default strategy to be used.
	This setting is very rarely required as the pluggable providers do specify the default strategy to use.
	Valid values include:
* read-only,
* read-write,
* nonstrict-read-write,
* transactional
`hibernate.cache.use_structured_entries`::
	If `true`, forces Hibernate to store data in the second-level cache in a more human-friendly format.
	Can be useful if you'd like to be able to "browse" the data directly in your cache, but does have a performance impact.
`hibernate.cache.auto_evict_collection_cache`::
	Enables or disables the automatic eviction of a bidirectional association's collection cache entry when the association is changed just from the owning side.
	This is disabled by default, as it has a performance impact to track this state.
	However, if your application does not manage both sides of bidirectional association where the collection side is cached,
	the alternative is to have stale data in that collection cache.
`hibernate.cache.use_reference_entries`::
	Enable direct storage of entity references into the second level cache for read-only or immutable entities.
`hibernate.cache.keys_factory`::
    When storing entries into the second-level cache as a key-value pair, the identifiers can be wrapped into tuples
    <entity type, tenant, identifier> to guarantee uniqueness in case that second-level cache stores all entities
    in single space. These tuples are then used as keys in the cache. When the second-level cache implementation
    (incl. its configuration) guarantees that different entity types are stored separately and multi-tenancy is not
    used, you can omit this wrapping to achieve better performance. Currently, this property is only supported when
    Infinispan is configured as the second-level cache implementation. Valid values are:
* `default` (wraps identifiers in the tuple)
* `simple` (uses identifiers as keys without any wrapping)
* fully qualified class name that implements `org.hibernate.cache.spi.CacheKeysFactory`

[[caching-mappings]]
=== Configuring second-level cache mappings

The cache mappings can be configured via Jakarta Persistence annotations or XML descriptors or using the Hibernate-specific mapping files.

By default, entities are not part of the second level cache and we recommend you to stick to this setting.
However, you can override this by setting the `shared-cache-mode` element in your `persistence.xml` file
or by using the `jakarta.persistence.sharedCache.mode` property in your configuration file.
The following values are possible:

`ENABLE_SELECTIVE` (Default and recommended value)::
	Entities are not cached unless explicitly marked as cacheable (with the {jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}Cacheable.html[`@Cacheable`] annotation).
`DISABLE_SELECTIVE`::
	Entities are cached unless explicitly marked as non-cacheable.
`ALL`::
	Entities are always cached even if marked as non-cacheable.
`NONE`::
	No entity is cached even if marked as cacheable.
	This option can make sense to disable second-level cache altogether.

The cache concurrency strategy used by default can be set globally via the `hibernate.cache.default_cache_concurrency_strategy` configuration property.
The values for this property are:

read-only::
	If your application needs to read, but not modify, instances of a persistent class, a read-only cache is the best choice.
	Application can still delete entities and these changes should be reflected in second-level cache so that the cache
	does not provide stale entities.
	Implementations may use performance optimizations based on the immutability of entities.
read-write::
	If the application needs to update data, a read-write cache might be appropriate.
	This strategy provides consistent access to single entity, but not a serializable transaction isolation level; e.g. when TX1 reads looks up an entity and does not find it, TX2 inserts the entity into cache and TX1 looks it up again, the new entity can be read in TX1.
nonstrict-read-write::
    Similar to read-write strategy but there might be occasional stale reads upon concurrent access to an entity. The choice of this strategy might be appropriate if the application rarely updates the same data simultaneously and strict transaction isolation is not required. Implementations may use performance optimizations that make use of the relaxed consistency guarantee.
transactional::
    Provides serializable transaction isolation level.

[NOTE]
====
Rather than using a global setting, it is recommended to define the cache concurrency strategy on a per entity basis.

Use the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/annotations/Cache.html[`@org.hibernate.annotations.Cache`] annotation for this purpose.
====

The `@Cache` annotation define three attributes:

usage::
	Defines the `CacheConcurrencyStrategy`
region::
	Defines a cache region where entries will be stored
include::
	If lazy properties should be included in the second level cache.
	The default value is `all` so lazy properties are cacheable.
	The other possible value is `non-lazy` so lazy properties are not cacheable.

[[caching-mappings-inheritance]]
=== Entity inheritance and second-level cache mapping

Traditionally, when using entity inheritance, Hibernate required an entity hierarchy to be either cached entirely or not cached at all.
Therefore, if you wanted to cache a subclass belonging to a given entity hierarchy,
the Jakarta Persistence `@Cacheable` and the Hibernate-specific `@Cache` annotations would have to be declared at the root-entity level only.

Although we still believe that all entities belonging to a given entity hierarchy should share the same caching semantics,
the Jakarta Persistence specification says that the `@Cacheable` annotation could be overwritten by a subclass:

[quote, Section 11.1.7 of the Jakarta Persistence]
____
The value of the `Cacheable` annotation is inherited by subclasses; it can be overridden by specifying `Cacheable` on a subclass.
____

[NOTE]
====
As of Hibernate ORM 5.3, you can now override a base class `@Cacheable` or `@Cache` definition at subclass level.

However, the Hibernate cache concurrency strategy (e.g. read-only, nonstrict-read-write, read-write, transactional) is still defined at the root entity level and cannot be overridden.
====

Nevertheless, the reasons why we advise you to have all entities belonging to an inheritance tree share the same caching definition can be summed as follows:

- from a performance perspective, adding an additional check on a per entity type level slows the bootstrap process.
- providing different caching semantics for subclasses would violate the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle[Liskov substitution principle].

[[caching-entity]]
=== Entity cache

====

Hibernate stores cached entities in a dehydrated form, which is similar to the database representation.
Aside from the foreign key column values of the `@ManyToOne` or `@OneToOne` child-side associations,
entity relationships are not stored in the cache,

Once an entity is stored in the second-level cache, you can avoid a database hit and load the entity from the cache alone:

----

[[caching-collection]]
=== Collection cache

Hibernate can also cache collections, and the `@Cache` annotation must be on added to the collection property.

If the collection is made of value types (basic or embeddables mapped with `@ElementCollection`),
the collection is stored as such.
If the collection contains other entities (`@OneToMany` or `@ManyToMany`),
the collection cache entry will store the entity identifiers only.

include::{example-dir-caching}/NonStrictReadWriteCacheTest.java[tags=caching-collection-mapping-example]

Collections are read-through, meaning they are cached upon being accessed for the first time:

include::{example-dir-caching}/NonStrictReadWriteCacheTest.java[tags=caching-collection-example]

====

Subsequent collection retrievals will use the cache instead of going to the database.

[NOTE]
====
The collection cache is not write-through so any modification will trigger a collection cache entry invalidation.
On a subsequent access, the collection will be loaded from the database and re-cached.
====

[[caching-query]]
=== Query cache

Aside from caching entities and collections, Hibernate offers a query cache too.
This is useful for frequently executed queries with fixed parameter values.

[NOTE]
====
Caching of query results introduces some overhead in terms of your application's normal transactional processing.
For example, if you cache results of a query against `Person`,
Hibernate will need to keep track of when those results should be invalidated because changes have been committed against any `Person` entity.

That, coupled with the fact that most applications simply gain no benefit from caching query results,
leads Hibernate to disable caching of query results by default.
====

To use query caching, you will first need to enable it with the following configuration property:

[[caching-query-configuration]]
.Enabling query cache
====
[source, XML, indent=0]
----
<property
    name="hibernate.cache.use_query_cache"
    value="true" />
----
====

As mentioned above, most queries do not benefit from caching or their results.
So by default, individual queries are not cached even after enabling query caching.
Each particular query that needs to be cached must be manually set as cacheable.
This way, the query looks for existing cache results or adds the query results to the cache when being executed.

====

[NOTE]
====
The query cache contents for selected/fetched entities and fetched collections depends on the <<caching-query-cache-layout,query cache layout>>.
====

[[caching-query-region]]
==== Query cache regions

This setting creates two new cache regions:

`default-query-results-region`::
	Holding the cached query results.
`default-update-timestamps-region`::
	Holding timestamps of the most recent updates to queryable tables.
	These are used to validate the results as they are served from the query cache.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you configure your underlying cache implementation to use expiration, it's very important
that the timeout of the underlying cache region for the `default-update-timestamps-region`
is set to a higher value than the timeout setting of any of the query caches.

In fact, we recommend that the `default-update-timestamps-region` region is not configured for expiration (time-based) or eviction (size/memory-based) at all.
Note that an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache eviction policy is never appropriate for this particular cache region.
====

If you require fine-grained control over query cache expiration policies,
you can specify a named cache region for a particular query.

Hibernate will selectively force the results cached in that particular region to be refreshed.

This behavior is particularly useful in cases when the underlying data may have been updated via a separate process
and is a far more efficient alternative to the bulk eviction of the region via `SessionFactory` eviction which looks as follows:

include::{example-dir-caching}/SecondLevelCacheTest.java[tags=caching-query-region-native-evict-example]
----
====

[[caching-query-cache-layout]]
=== Query cache layout

The query cache usually contains the same data that is read from the original query's JDBC `ResultSet`,
but for entities and collections the cached information can vary depending on configuration.

An entity or collection in the query cache can either be represented with all its fetched data (`FULL` cache layout),
or with just the identifier or collection owner key (`SHALLOW` cache layout).
With the identifier or collection owner key, Hibernate ORM can then consult an entity or collection cache to retrieve the final entity data.
The shallow query cache layout is hence only effective for entities/collections for which such a second level cache exists,
and only if there is a very high cache hit rate i.e. few cache invalidations.
Whenever a shallow cached entity/collection can not be found in the second level cache,
Hibernate ORM will load the data from the database by identifier or collection owner key respectively,
which can lead to a lot of additional queries if the second level cache does not have a high cache hit rate.

Since loading polymorphic entities might involve querying multiple tables,
it is possible to store the discriminator of an entity along with the identifier (`SHALLOW_WITH_DISCRIMINATOR` cache layout)
to potentially avoid costly queries in case of a second level cache miss.

The default query cache layout `AUTO` will choose `SHALLOW` for entities and collections that are cacheable
and `FULL` otherwise, because query caching of entity or collection data is generally only advisable for high cache hit rates.

To change the query cache layout, applications can set the global configuration setting <<caching-config-properties,`hibernate.cache.query_cache_layout`>>.
It is also possible to configure the query cache layout for an entity type or persistent collection with the `@QueryCacheLayout` annotation,
by placing the annotation on the entity class or the persistent collection attribute.


[[caching-management]]
=== Managing the cached data

Traditionally, Hibernate defined the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/CacheMode.html[`CacheMode`] enumeration to describe
the ways of interactions with the cached data.
Jakarta Persistence split cache modes by storage ({jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}CacheStoreMode.html[`CacheStoreMode`])
and retrieval ({jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}CacheRetrieveMode.html[`CacheRetrieveMode`]).

The relationship between Hibernate and Jakarta Persistence cache modes can be seen in the following table:

.Cache modes relationships
[cols=",,",options="header",]
|======================================
|Hibernate 			 | Jakarta Persistence | Description
|`CacheMode.NORMAL`  |`CacheStoreMode.USE` and `CacheRetrieveMode.USE` | Default. Reads/writes data from/into the cache
|`CacheMode.REFRESH` |`CacheStoreMode.REFRESH` and `CacheRetrieveMode.BYPASS` | Doesn't read from cache, but writes to the cache upon loading from the database
|`CacheMode.PUT`     |`CacheStoreMode.USE` and `CacheRetrieveMode.BYPASS` | Doesn't read from cache, but writes to the cache as it reads from the database
|`CacheMode.GET`     |`CacheStoreMode.BYPASS` and `CacheRetrieveMode.USE` | Read from the cache, but doesn't write to cache
|`CacheMode.IGNORE`  |`CacheStoreMode.BYPASS` and `CacheRetrieveMode.BYPASS` | Doesn't read/write data from/into the cache
|======================================

Setting the cache mode can be done either when loading entities directly or when executing a query.

[[caching-management-evict]]
==== Evicting cache entries

Because the second level cache is bound to the `EntityManagerFactory` or the `SessionFactory`,
cache eviction must be done through these two interfaces.

Jakarta Persistence only supports entity eviction through the {jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}Cache.html[`jakarta.persistence.Cache`] interface:

Hibernate is much more flexible in this regard as it offers fine-grained control over what needs to be evicted.
The https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/Cache.html[`org.hibernate.Cache`] interface defines various evicting strategies:

- entities (by their class or region)
- entities stored using the natural-id (by their class or region)
- collections (by the region, and it might take the collection owner identifier as well)
- queries (by region)

If you enable the `hibernate.generate_statistics` configuration property,
Hibernate will expose a number of metrics via `SessionFactory.getStatistics()`.
Hibernate can even be configured to expose these statistics via JMX.

This way, you can get access to the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/stat/Statistics.html[`Statistics`] class which comprises all sort of
second-level cache metrics.

[NOTE]
====
To use the built-in integration for https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107[JCache], you need the `hibernate-jcache` module jar (and all of its dependencies) to be on the classpath.

In addition, a JCache implementation needs to be added as well.
A list of compatible implementations can be found https://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/implementations/jsr107/index.html[on the JCP website].
An alternative source of compatible implementations can be found through https://github.com/cruftex/jsr107-test-zoo[the JSR-107 test zoo].
====

[[caching-provider-jcache-region-factory]]
==== RegionFactory

The `hibernate-jcache` module defines the following region factory: `JCacheRegionFactory`.

To use the `JCacheRegionFactory`, you need to specify the following configuration property:

[[caching-provider-jcache-region-factory-example]]
.`JCacheRegionFactory` configuration
====
[source, XML, indent=0]
----
<property
    name="hibernate.cache.region.factory_class"
    value="jcache"/>
----
====

The `JCacheRegionFactory` configures a `javax.cache.CacheManager`.

[[caching-provider-jcache-cache-manager]]
==== JCache `CacheManager`

JCache mandates that `CacheManager`{empty}s sharing the same URI and class loader be unique in JVM.

If you do not specify additional properties, the `JCacheRegionFactory` will load the default JCache provider and create the default `CacheManager`.
Also, `Cache`{empty}s will be created using the default `javax.cache.configuration.MutableConfiguration`.

In order to control which provider to use and specify configuration for the `CacheManager` and `Cache`{empty}s you can use the following two properties:

[[caching-provider-jcache-region-factory-config-example]]
.JCache configuration
====
[source, XML, indent=0]
----
<property
    name="hibernate.javax.cache.provider"
    value="org.ehcache.jsr107.EhcacheCachingProvider"/>
<property
    name="hibernate.javax.cache.uri"
    value="file:/path/to/ehcache.xml"/>
----
====

Only by specifying the second property `hibernate.javax.cache.uri` will you be able to have a `CacheManager` per `SessionFactory`.

===== Using a non-default JCache `CacheManager`

If you don't want to use the default `CacheManager`, you need to set the `hibernate.javax.cache.cache_manager` configuration property
to one of the following values:

Object reference:: If the value is an `Object` instance implementing the `CacheManager` interface,
the provided `CacheManager` instance will be used.
`Class`:: If the value is a Java `Class` object that implements the `CacheManager` interface,
Hibernate will create a new instance for that `Class` and use it instead of the default one.
+
[NOTE]
====
When passing a Java `Class` that implements the `CacheManager` interface, you must make sure that the `CacheManager` implementation class provides a default no-arg constructor because that's going to be used to instantiate a `CacheManager` implementation `Object`.
====
`String`:: If the value is a Java `String`, Hibernate expects it to be the fully-qualified `Class` name
of the `CacheManager` implementation which will be used to instantiate the non-default `CacheManager`.
+
[NOTE]
====
When passing the fully-qualified class name, you must make sure that the associated `Class` type provides a default no-arg constructor because that's going to be used to instantiate a `CacheManager` implementation `Object`.
====

[[caching-provider-jcache-missing-cache-strategy]]
==== JCache missing cache strategy

By default, the JCache region factory
will log a warning when asked to create a cache that is not explicitly configured and pre-started in the underlying cache manager.
Thus if you configure an entity type or a collection as cached, but do not configure the corresponding cache explicitly,
one warning will be logged for each cache that was not configured explicitly.

You may change this behavior by setting the `hibernate.javax.cache.missing_cache_strategy` property
to one of the following values:

.Missing cache strategies
[cols=",",options="header",]
|======================================
| Value        | Description
|`fail`        | Fail with an exception on missing caches.
|`create-warn` | **Default value**. Create a new cache when a cache is not found (see `create` below),
and also log a warning about the missing cache.
|`create`      | Create a new cache when a cache is not found, without logging any warning about the missing cache.
|======================================

[WARNING]
====
Note that caches created this way may not be suitable for production usage (unlimited size and no eviction in particular) unless the cache provider explicitly provides a specific configuration for default caches.

Recent versions of Ehcache enable disk persistence (`<persistence strategy="localTempSwap"/>`) for the default cache causing performance degradation, it is highly recommended to define the caches explicitly (see Hibernate Jira issue https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-14544[HHH-14544]).

Ehcache, in particular, allows to set such default configuration using cache templates. See the https://www.ehcache.org/documentation/3.0/107.html#supplement-jsr-107-configurations[Ehcache documentation] for more details.
