As a Jakarta Persistence provider, Hibernate can introspect both the entity attributes (instance fields) or the accessors (instance properties).
By default, the placement of the `@Id` annotation gives the default access strategy.
When placed on a field, Hibernate will assume field-based access.
When placed on the identifier getter, Hibernate will use property-based access.

====
To avoid issues such as
https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HCANN-63[HCANN-63 - Property name beginning with at least two uppercase characters has odd functionality in HQL], you should pay attention to
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/Introspector.html#decapitalize(java.lang.String)[Java Bean specification] in regard to naming properties.

Embeddable types inherit the access strategy from their parent entities.

When using field-based access, adding other entity-level methods is much more flexible because Hibernate won't consider those part of the persistence state.
To exclude a field from being part of the entity persistent state, the field must be marked with the `@Transient` annotation.

[NOTE]
====
Another advantage of using field-based access is that some entity attributes can be hidden from outside the entity.

An example of such attribute is the entity `@Version` field, which, usually, does not need to be manipulated by the data access layer.

With field-based access, we can simply omit the getter and the setter for this version field, and Hibernate can still leverage the optimistic concurrency control mechanism.

When using property-based access, Hibernate uses the accessors for both reading and writing the entity state.
Every other method that will be added to the entity (e.g. helper methods for synchronizing both ends of a bidirectional one-to-many association) will have to be marked with the `@Transient` annotation.

==== Overriding the default access strategy

The default access strategy mechanism can be overridden with the Jakarta Persistence `@Access` annotation.
In the following example, the `@Version` attribute is accessed by its field and not by its getter, like the rest of entity attributes.

[[access-embeddable-types]]
==== Embeddable types and access strategy

Because embeddables are managed by their owning entities, the access strategy is therefore inherited from the entity too.
This applies to both simple embeddable types as well as for collection of embeddables.

The embeddable types can overrule the default implicit access strategy (inherited from the owning entity).
In the following example, the embeddable uses property-based access, no matter what access strategy the owning entity is choosing:

[[access-embeddable-mapping-example]]
.Embeddable with exclusive access strategy
====
[source,java]
----
include::{example-dir-access}/EmbeddableAccessTest.java[tag=access-embeddable-mapping-example, indent=0]
----
====

The owning entity can use field-based access while the embeddable uses property-based access as it has chosen explicitly:

[[access-embedded-mapping-example]]
.Entity including a single embeddable type
====
[source,java]
----
include::{example-dir-access}/EmbeddableAccessTest.java[tag=access-embedded-mapping-example, indent=0]
----
====

This works also for collection of embeddable types:

[[access-element-collection-mapping-example]]
.Entity including a collection of embeddable types
====
[source,java]
----
include::{example-dir-access}/ElementCollectionAccessTest.java[tag=access-element-collection-mapping-example, indent=0]
