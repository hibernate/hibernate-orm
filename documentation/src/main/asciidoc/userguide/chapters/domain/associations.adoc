Associations describe how two or more entities form a relationship based on a database joining semantics.

[[associations-many-to-one]]
==== `@ManyToOne`

`@ManyToOne` is the most common association, having a direct equivalent in the relational database as well (e.g. foreign key),
and so it establishes a relationship between a child entity and a parent.

Each entity has a lifecycle of its own. Once the `@ManyToOne` association is set, Hibernate will set the associated database foreign key column.

====

[[associations-one-to-many]]
==== `@OneToMany`

The `@OneToMany` association links a parent entity with one or more child entities.
If the `@OneToMany` doesn't have a mirroring `@ManyToOne` association on the child side, the `@OneToMany` association is unidirectional.
If there is a `@ManyToOne` association on the child side, the `@OneToMany` association is bidirectional and the application developer can navigate this relationship from both ends.

[[associations-one-to-many-unidirectional]]
===== Unidirectional `@OneToMany`

When using a unidirectional `@OneToMany` association, Hibernate resorts to using a link table between the two joining entities.

----
====

[NOTE]
====
The `@OneToMany` association is by definition a parent association, regardless of whether it's a unidirectional or a bidirectional one.
Only the parent side of an association makes sense to cascade its entity state transitions to children.

----
====

When persisting the `Person` entity, the cascade will propagate the persist operation to the underlying `Phone` children as well.
Upon removing a `Phone` from the phones collection, the association row is deleted from the link table, and the `orphanRemoval` attribute will trigger a `Phone` removal as well.

[NOTE]
====
The unidirectional associations are not very efficient when it comes to removing child entities.
In the example above, upon flushing the persistence context, Hibernate deletes all database rows from the link table (e.g. `Person_Phone`) that are associated with the parent `Person` entity and reinserts the ones that are still found in the `@OneToMany` collection.

On the other hand, a bidirectional `@OneToMany` association is much more efficient because the child entity controls the association.
====

[[associations-one-to-many-bidirectional]]
===== Bidirectional `@OneToMany`

The bidirectional `@OneToMany` association also requires a `@ManyToOne` association on the child side.
Although the Domain Model exposes two sides to navigate this association, behind the scenes, the relational database has only one foreign key for this relationship.

Every bidirectional association must have one owning side only (the child side), the other one being referred to as the _inverse_ (or the `mappedBy`) side.

----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
Whenever a bidirectional association is formed, the application developer must make sure both sides are in-sync at all times.

The `addPhone()` and `removePhone()` are utility methods that synchronize both ends whenever a child element is added or removed.
====

Because the `Phone` class has a `@NaturalId` column (the phone number being unique),
the `equals()` and the `hashCode()` can make use of this property, and so the `removePhone()` logic is reduced to the `remove()` Java `Collection` method.

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-one-to-many-bidirectional-lifecycle-example.sql[]
----
====

Unlike the unidirectional `@OneToMany`, the bidirectional association is much more efficient when managing the collection persistence state.
Every element removal only requires a single update (in which the foreign key column is set to `NULL`), and,
if the child entity lifecycle is bound to its owning parent so that the child cannot exist without its parent,
then we can annotate the association with the `orphanRemoval` attribute and dissociating the child will trigger a delete statement on the actual child table row as well.

[[associations-one-to-one]]
==== `@OneToOne`

The `@OneToOne` association can either be unidirectional or bidirectional.
A unidirectional association follows the relational database foreign key semantics, the client-side owning the relationship.
A bidirectional association features a `mappedBy` `@OneToOne` parent side too.

[[associations-one-to-one-unidirectional]]
===== Unidirectional `@OneToOne`

[[associations-one-to-one-unidirectional-example]]
.Unidirectional `@OneToOne`

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-one-to-one-unidirectional-example.sql[]
----
====

From a relational database point of view, the underlying schema is identical to the unidirectional `@ManyToOne` association,
as the client-side controls the relationship based on the foreign key column.

But then, it's unusual to consider the `Phone` as a client-side and the `PhoneDetails` as the parent-side because the details cannot exist without an actual phone.
A much more natural mapping would be the `Phone` were the parent-side, therefore pushing the foreign key into the `PhoneDetails` table.
This mapping requires a bidirectional `@OneToOne` association as you can see in the following example:

[[associations-one-to-one-bidirectional]]
===== Bidirectional `@OneToOne`

[[associations-one-to-one-bidirectional-example]]
.Bidirectional `@OneToOne`

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-one-to-one-bidirectional-example.sql[]
----
====

This time, the `PhoneDetails` owns the association, and, like any bidirectional association, the parent-side can propagate its lifecycle to the child-side through cascading.

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-one-to-one-bidirectional-lifecycle-example.sql[]
----
====

When using a bidirectional `@OneToOne` association, Hibernate enforces the unique constraint upon fetching the child-side.
If there are more than one children associated with the same parent, Hibernate will throw a `org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException`.
Continuing the previous example, when adding another `PhoneDetails`, Hibernate validates the uniqueness constraint when reloading the `Phone` object.

====

[[associations-one-to-one-bidirectional-lazy]]
====== Bidirectional `@OneToOne` lazy association

Although you might annotate the parent-side association to be fetched lazily,
Hibernate cannot honor this request since it cannot know whether the association is `null` or not.

The only way to figure out whether there is an associated record on the child side is to fetch the child association using a secondary query.
Because this can lead to N+1 query issues, it's much more efficient to use unidirectional `@OneToOne` associations with the `@MapsId` annotation in place.

However, if you really need to use a bidirectional association and want to make sure that this is always going to be fetched lazily,
then you need to enable lazy state initialization bytecode enhancement.

see the <<chapters/pc/BytecodeEnhancement.adoc#BytecodeEnhancement, Bytecode Enhancement chapter>>.

[[associations-many-to-many]]
==== `@ManyToMany`

The `@ManyToMany` association requires a link table that joins two entities.
Like the `@OneToMany` association, `@ManyToMany` can be either unidirectional or bidirectional.

[[associations-many-to-many-unidirectional]]
===== Unidirectional `@ManyToMany`

[[associations-many-to-many-unidirectional-example]]

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-unidirectional-example.sql[]
----
====

Just like with unidirectional `@OneToMany` associations, the link table is controlled by the owning side.

When an entity is removed from the `@ManyToMany` collection, Hibernate simply deletes the joining record in the link table.
Unfortunately, this operation requires removing all entries associated with a given parent and recreating the ones that are listed in the current running persistent context.

[[associations-many-to-many-unidirectional-lifecycle-example]]
.Unidirectional `@ManyToMany` lifecycle

include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-unidirectional-lifecycle-example.sql[]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
For `@ManyToMany` associations, the `REMOVE` entity state transition doesn't make sense to be cascaded because it will propagate beyond the link table.
Since the other side might be referenced by other entities on the parent-side, the automatic removal might end up in a `ConstraintViolationException`.

For example, if `@ManyToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL)` was defined and the first person would be deleted,
Hibernate would throw an exception because another person is still associated with the address that's being deleted.

[source,java]
----
Person person1 = entityManager.find(Person.class, personId);
entityManager.remove(person1);

Caused by: jakarta.persistence.PersistenceException: org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: could not execute statement
Caused by: org.hibernate.exception.ConstraintViolationException: could not execute statement
Caused by: java.sql.SQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: integrity constraint violation: foreign key no action; FKM7J0BNABH2YR0PE99IL1D066U table: PERSON_ADDRESS
----
====

By simply removing the parent-side, Hibernate can safely remove the associated link records as you can see in the following example:

[[associations-many-to-many-unidirectional-remove-example]]

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional]]
===== Bidirectional `@ManyToMany`

A bidirectional `@ManyToMany` association has an owning and a `mappedBy` side.
To preserve synchronicity between both sides, it's good practice to provide helper methods for adding or removing child entities.

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-example]]
.Bidirectional `@ManyToMany`

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-example.sql[]
----
====

With the helper methods in place, the synchronicity management can be simplified, as you can see in the following example:

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-lifecycle-example]]
.Bidirectional `@ManyToMany` lifecycle

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-lifecycle-example.sql[]
----
====

If a bidirectional `@OneToMany` association performs better when removing or changing the order of child elements,
the `@ManyToMany` relationship cannot benefit from such an optimization because the foreign key side is not in control.
To overcome this limitation, the link table must be directly exposed and the `@ManyToMany` association split into two bidirectional `@OneToMany` relationships.

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity]]
===== Bidirectional many-to-many with a link entity

To most natural `@ManyToMany` association follows the same logic employed by the database schema,
and the link table has an associated entity which controls the relationship for both sides that need to be joined.

[[associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity-example]]
.Bidirectional many-to-many with link entity
====
[source,java]
----
include::{example-dir-association}/ManyToManyBidirectionalWithLinkEntityTest.java[tags=associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity-example,indent=0]
----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity-example.sql[]
----
====

Both the `Person` and the `Address` have a `mappedBy` `@OneToMany` side, while the `PersonAddress` owns the `person` and the `address` `@ManyToOne` associations.
Because this mapping is formed out of two bidirectional associations, the helper methods are even more relevant.

[NOTE]
====
The aforementioned example uses a Hibernate-specific mapping for the link entity since Jakarta Persistence doesn't allow building a composite identifier out of multiple `@ManyToOne` associations.

For more details, see the <<chapters/domain/identifiers.adoc#identifiers-composite-associations,composite identifiers with associations>> section.
====

The entity state transitions are better managed than in the previous bidirectional `@ManyToMany` case.

.Bidirectional many-to-many with link entity lifecycle

----
include::{extrasdir}/associations-many-to-many-bidirectional-with-link-entity-lifecycle-example.sql[]
----
====

There is only one delete statement executed because, this time, the association is controlled by the `@ManyToOne` side which only has to monitor the state of the underlying foreign key relationship to trigger the right DML statement.

[[associations-not-found]]
==== `@NotFound`

When dealing with associations which are not enforced by a physical foreign-key, it is possible
for a non-null foreign-key value to point to a non-existent value on the associated entity's table.

[WARNING]
====
Not enforcing physical foreign-keys at the database level is highly discouraged.
====

Hibernate provides support for such models using the `@NotFound` annotation, which accepts a
`NotFoundAction` value which indicates how Hibernate should behave when such broken foreign-keys
are encountered -

EXCEPTION:: (default) Hibernate will throw an exception (`FetchNotFoundException`)
IGNORE:: the association will be treated as `null`

Both `@NotFound(IGNORE)` and `@NotFound(EXCEPTION)` cause Hibernate to assume that there is
no physical foreign-key.

`@ManyToOne` and `@OneToOne` associations annotated with `@NotFound` are always fetched eagerly even
if the `fetch` strategy is set to `FetchType.LAZY`.


[TIP]
====
If the application itself manages the referential integrity and can guarantee that there are no
broken foreign-keys, `jakarta.persistence.ForeignKey(NO_CONSTRAINT)` can be used instead.
This will force Hibernate to not export physical foreign-keys, but still behave as if there is
in terms of avoiding the downsides to `@NotFound`.
====


Considering the following `City` and `Person` entity mappings:

====
[source,java]
----
include::{example-dir-association}/NotFoundTest.java[tags=associations-not-found-persist-example,indent=0]

include::{example-dir-association}/NotFoundTest.java[tags=associations-not-found-find-baseline,indent=0]

However, if we break the foreign-key:

.Break the foreign-key
====
[source,java]
----
include::{example-dir-association}/NotFoundTest.java[tags=associations-not-found-break-fk,indent=0]
----
====

Hibernate is not going to throw any exception, and it will assign a value of `null` for the non-existing `City` entity reference:

[[associations-not-found-non-existing-find-example]]
.`@NotFound` - find non-existing City example
====
[source,java]
----
include::{example-dir-association}/NotFoundTest.java[tags=associations-not-found-non-existing-find-example,indent=0]
----
====

`@NotFound` also affects how the association is treated as "implicit joins" in HQL and Criteria.
When there is a physical foreign-key, Hibernate can safely assume that the value in the foreign-key's
key-column(s) will match the value in the target-column(s) because the database makes sure that
is the case.  However, `@NotFound` forces Hibernate to perform a physical join for implicit joins
when it might not be needed otherwise.

Using the `Person` / `City` model, consider the query `from Person p where p.city.id is null`.

Normally Hibernate would not need the join between the `Person` table and the `City` table because
a physical foreign-key would ensure that any non-null value in the `Person.cityName` column
has a matching non-null value in the `City.name` column.

However, with `@NotFound` mappings it is possible to have a broken association because there is no
physical foreign-key enforcing the relation.  As seen in <<associations-not-found-non-existing-persist-example>>,
the `Person.cityName` column for John Doe has been changed from "New York" to "Atlantis" even though
there is no `City` in the database named "Atlantis".  Hibernate is not able to trust the referring
foreign-key value ("Atlantis") has a matching target value, so it must join to the `City` table to
resolve the `city.id` value.

Neither result includes a match for "John Doe" because the inner-join filters out that row.

[[associations-any]]
==== `@Any` mapping

The `@Any` mapping is useful to emulate a unidirectional `@ManyToOne` association when there can be multiple target entities.

Because the `@Any` mapping defines a polymorphic association to classes from multiple tables,
this association type requires the FK column which provides the associated parent identifier and
a discriminator which identifies the associated entity type.

[NOTE]
====
This is not the usual way of mapping polymorphic associations and you should use this only in special cases (e.g. audit logs, user session data, etc).
====

To map such an association, Hibernate needs to understand 3 things:

1. The column and mapping for the <<associations-any-discriminator,discriminator>>
2. The column and mapping for the <<associations-any-key,key>>
3. The mapping between discriminator values and entity types which may be <<associations-any-explicit-discriminator,explicit>>
<<associations-any-implicit-discriminator,implicit>> or <<associations-any-mixed-discriminator,mixed>>.

For the rest of this discussion, consider the following model which will be the target types for the `@Any` associations:

[[associations-any-target-example]]

include::{example-dir-any}/discriminator/CheckPayment.java[tags=associations-any-example]
----
====


[[associations-any-discriminator]]
===== The discriminator

The discriminator is the value that indicates which entity is referred to by a row.

Its "column" can be specified with either `@Column` or `@Formula`.  The mapping type can be influenced by any of:

1. `@AnyDiscriminator` allows re-using the `DiscriminatorType` simplified mappings from Jakarta Persistence for the common cases
2. `@JavaType`
3. `@JdbcType`
4. `@JdbcTypeCode`


[[associations-any-key]]
===== The key

The key of an any-style association holds the matching key for the row

Its "column" can be specified with either `@JoinColumn` (`@JoinFormula` not supported).  The mapping
type can be influenced by any of:

1. `@AnyKeyJavaClass`
2. `@AnyKeyJavaType`
3. `@AnyKeyJdbcType`
4. `@AnyKeyJdbcTypeCode`



[[associations-any-explicit-discriminator]]
===== Explicit discriminator mappings

Explicit discriminator mappings are defined using one-or-more `@AnyDiscriminatorValue` annotations.  E.g.


[[associations-any-discriminator-explicit-example]]
.Explicit @AnyDiscriminatorValue annotations
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-any}/discriminator/explicit/Order.java[tags=associations-any-explicit-discriminator-example]
----
====

Here, we map 2 explicit discriminator value mappings:

1. `CARD` <-> `CardPayment`
2. `CHECK` <-> `CheckPayment`

Notice that `CashPayment` is not explicitly mapped.  An attempt to use `CashPayment` for this attribute will result
in an exception.


[[associations-any-implicit-discriminator]]
===== Implicit discriminator mappings

Implicit discriminator mappings define no `@AnyDiscriminatorValue` annotations.  E.g.

[[associations-any-discriminator-implicit-example]]
.Implicit @Any discriminator mappings
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-any}/discriminator/implicit/Order.java[tags=associations-any-implicit-discriminator-example]
----
====

Here all `Payment` subtypes are allowed.  By default Hibernate will use the entity's full-name (which is generally the class's FQN).

Hibernate also offers a `@AnyDiscriminatorImplicitValues` annotation which allows configuration of how this implicit
mapping works.  E.g., to use the entity's short-name instead of the full-name -


[[associations-any-discriminator-implicit-short-example]]
.Implicit @Any discriminator mappings (short name)
====

----
include::{example-dir-any}/discriminator/implicit/Order.java[tags=associations-any-implicit-discriminator-short-example]

[NOTE]
====
`@AnyDiscriminatorImplicitValues` also offers the ability to define a custom strategy for determining the
discriminator-value <-> entity-type mapping, but its use is not covered here.
====


[[associations-any-mixed-discriminator]]
===== Mixed discriminator mappings

A mixed strategy combines `@AnyDiscriminatorValue` and `@AnyDiscriminatorImplicitValues`.  Mappings
explicitly defined using `@AnyDiscriminatorValue` take precedence.  E.g.

[[associations-any-meta-annotations]]
===== Using meta-annotations

As mentioned in <<basic-mapping>>, Hibernate's ANY-related annotations can be composed using meta-annotations
to re-use ANY mapping details.

Given all the details needed to define an ANY mapping, we can see how cumbersome it would be to duplicate that
information every time `Payment` is mapped in the domain model.  This description can also be moved
into a single annotation that we can apply in each usage.

[[associations-many-to-any]]
===== `@ManyToAny` mapping

While the `@Any` mapping is useful to emulate a `@ManyToOne` association when there can be multiple target entities,
to emulate a `@OneToMany` association, the `@ManyToAny` annotation must be used.

The mapping details are the same between `@Any` and `@ManyToAny` except for:

1. The use of `@ManyToAny` instead of `@Any`
2. The use of `@JoinTable`, `@JoinTable#joinColumns` and `@JoinTable#inverseJoinColumns` instead
    of just `@JoinColumn`


In the following example, the `Loan` entity has a collection of `Payments` objects.

The `loan_payments` table holds the associations between `Loan` and `Payment` references.
