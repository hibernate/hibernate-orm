=== Collections
:sourcedir: ../../../../../test/java/org/hibernate/userguide/collections
:extrasdir: extras/collections

Naturally Hibernate also allows to persist collections. 
These persistent collections can contain almost any other Hibernate type, including: basic types, custom types, components and references to other entities. 
In this context, the distinction between value and reference semantics is very important. 
An object in a collection might be handled with _value_ semantics (its life cycle being fully depends on the collection owner), 
or it might be a reference to another entity with its own life cycle. 
In the latter case, only the _link_ between the two objects is considered to be a state held by the collection.

The owner of the collection is always an entity, even if the collection is defined by an embeddable type.
Collections form one/many-to-many associations between types so there can be:

- value type collections
- embeddable type collections
- entity collections

Hibernate uses its own collection implementations which are enriched with lazy-loading, caching or state change detection semantics.
For this reason, persistent collections must be declared as an interface type.
The actual interface might be `java.util.Collection`, `java.util.List`, `java.util.Set`, `java.util.Map`, `java.util.SortedSet`, `java.util.SortedMap` or even other object types (meaning you will have to write an implementation of `org.hibernate.usertype.UserCollectionType`).

As the following example demonstrates, it's important to use the interface type and not the collection implementation, as declared in the entity mapping.

[NOTE]
====
It is important that collections be defined using the appropriate Java Collections Framework interface rather than a specific implementation.
From a theoretical perspective, this just follows good design principles.
From a practical perspective, Hibernate (like other persistence providers) will use their own collection implementations which conform to the Java Collections Framework interfaces.
====

The persistent collections injected by Hibernate behave like `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `TreeSet`, `HashMap` or `TreeMap`, depending on the interface type.

[[collections-synopsis]]
==== Collections as a value type

Value and embeddable type collections have a similar behavior as simple value types because they are automatically persisted when referenced by a persistent object and automatically deleted when unreferenced.
If a collection is passed from one persistent object to another, its elements might be moved from one table to another.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Two entities cannot share a reference to the same collection instance.
Collection-valued properties do not support null value semantics because Hibernate does not distinguish between a null collection reference and an empty collection.
====

[[collections-value]]
==== Collections of value types

Collections of value type include basic and embeddable types.
Collections cannot be nested, and, when used in collections, embeddable types are not allowed to define other collections.

For collections of value types, JPA 2.0 defines the `@ElementCollection` annotation.
The lifecycle of the value-type collection is entirely controlled by its owning entity.

Considering the previous example mapping, when clearing the phone collection, Hibernate deletes all the associated phones.
When adding a new element to the value type collection, Hibernate issues a new insert statement.

If removing all elements or adding new ones is rather straightforward, removing a certain entry actually requires reconstructing the whole collection from scratch.

----
====

Depending on the number of elements, this behavior might not be efficient, if many elements need to be deleted and reinserted back into the database table.
A workaround is to use an `@OrderColumn`, which, although not as efficient as when using the actual link table primary key, might improve the efficiency of the remove operations.

----
====

[NOTE]
====
The `@OrderColumn` column works best when removing from the tail of the collection, as it only requires a single delete statement.
Removing from the head or the middle of the collection requires deleting the extra elements and updating the remaining ones to preserve element order.
====

Embeddable type collections behave the same way as value type collections.
Adding embeddables to the collection triggers the associated insert statements and removing elements from the collection will generate delete statements.

[[collections-entity]]
==== Collections of entities

If value type collections can only form a one-to-many association between an owner entity and multiple basic or embeddable types,
entity collections can represent both <<chapters/domain/associations.adoc#associations-one-to-many,@OneToMany>> and <<chapters/domain/associations.adoc#associations-many-to-many,@ManyToMany>> associations.

From a relational database perspective, associations are defined by the foreign key side (the child-side).
With value type collections, only the entity can control the association (the parent-side), but for a collection of entities, both sides of the association are managed by the persistence context.

For this reason, entity collections can be devised into two main categories: unidirectional and bidirectional associations.
Unidirectional associations are very similar to value type collections since only the parent side controls this relationship.
Bidirectional associations are more tricky since, even if sides need to be in-sync at all times, only one side is responsible for managing the association.
A bidirectional association has an _owning_ side and an _inverse (mappedBy)_ side.

Another way of categorizing entity collections is by the underlying collection type, and so we can have:

* bags
* indexed lists
* sets
* sorted sets
* maps
* sorted maps
* arrays

In the following sections, we will go through all these collection types and discuss both unidirectional and bidirectional associations.

[[collections-bag]]
==== Bags

Bags are unordered lists and we can have unidirectional bags or bidirectional ones.

[[collections-unidirectional-bag]]
===== Unidirectional bags

The unidirectional bag is mapped using a single `@OneToMany` annotation on the parent side of the association.
Behind the scenes, Hibernate requires an association table to manage the parent-child relationship, as we can see in the following example:

[[collections-unidirectional-bag-example]]
.Unidirectional bag
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UnidirectionalBagTest.java[tags=collections-unidirectional-bag-example,indent=0]
----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-unidirectional-bag-example.sql[]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Because both the parent and the child sides are entities, the persistence context manages each entity separately.
Cascades can propagate an entity state transition from a parent entity to its children.
====

By marking the parent side with the `CascadeType.ALL` attribute, the unidirectional association lifecycle becomes very similar to that of a value type collection.

[[collections-unidirectional-bag-lifecycle-example]]
.Unidirectional bag lifecycle
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UnidirectionalBagTest.java[tags=collections-unidirectional-bag-lifecycle-example,indent=0]
----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-unidirectional-bag-lifecycle-example.sql[]
----
====

In the example above, once the parent entity is persisted, the child entities are going to be persisted as well.

[NOTE]
====
Just like value type collections, unidirectional bags are not as efficient when it comes to modifying the collection structure (removing or reshuffling elements).
Because the parent-side cannot uniquely identify each individual child, Hibernate might delete all child table rows associated with the parent entity and re-add them according to the current collection state.
====

[[collections-bidirectional-bag]]
===== Bidirectional bags

The bidirectional bag is the most common type of entity collection.
The `@ManyToOne` side is the owning side of the bidirectional bag association, while the `@OneToMany` is the _inverse_ side, being marked with the `mappedBy` attribute.

[[collections-bidirectional-bag-example]]
.Bidirectional bag
====

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-bidirectional-bag-orphan-removal-example.sql[]
----
====

When rerunning the previous example, the child will get removed because the parent-side propagates the removal upon disassociating the child entity reference.

[[collections-list]]
==== Ordered Lists

Although they use the `List` interface on the Java side, bags don't retain element order.
To preserve the collection element order, there are two possibilities:

`@OrderBy`:: the collection is ordered upon retrieval using a child entity property
`@OrderColumn`:: the collection uses a dedicated order column in the collection link table

[[collections-unidirectional-ordered-list]]
===== Unidirectional ordered lists

When using the `@OrderBy` annotation, the mapping looks as follows:

[[collections-unidirectional-ordered-list-order-by-example]]
.Unidirectional `@OrderBy` list
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UnidirectionalOrderedByListTest.java[tags=collections-unidirectional-ordered-list-order-by-example,indent=0]
----
====

The database mapping is the same as with the <<collections-unidirectional-bag>> example, so it won't be repeated.
Upon fetching the collection, Hibernate generates the following select statement:

[[collections-unidirectional-ordered-list-order-by-select-example]]
.Unidirectional `@OrderBy` list select statement
====
[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-unidirectional-ordered-list-order-by-select-example.sql[]
----
====

The child table column is used to order the list elements.

[NOTE]
====
The `@OrderBy` annotation can take multiple entity properties, and each property can take an ordering direction too (e.g. `@OrderBy("name ASC, type DESC")`).

If no property is specified (e.g. `@OrderBy`), the primary key of the child entity table is used for ordering.
====

Another ordering option is to use the `@OrderColumn` annotation:

[[collections-unidirectional-ordered-list-order-column-example]]
.Unidirectional `@OrderColumn` list
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UnidirectionalOrderColumnListTest.java[tags=collections-unidirectional-ordered-list-order-column-example,indent=0]
----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-unidirectional-ordered-list-order-column-example.sql[]
----
====

This time, the link table takes the `order_id` column and uses it to materialize the collection element order.
When fetching the list, the following select query is executed:

[[collections-unidirectional-ordered-list-order-column-select-example]]
.Unidirectional `@OrderColumn` list select statement
====
[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-unidirectional-ordered-list-order-column-select-example.sql[]
----
====

With the `order_id` column in place, Hibernate can order the list in-memory after it's being fetched from the database.

[[collections-bidirectional-ordered-list]]
===== Bidirectional ordered lists

The mapping is similar with the <<collections-bidirectional-bag>> example, just that the parent side is going to be annotated with either `@OrderBy` or `@OrderColumn`.

[[collections-bidirectional-ordered-list-order-by-example]]
.Bidirectional `@OrderBy` list
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/BidirectionalOrderByListTest.java[tags=collections-bidirectional-ordered-list-order-by-example,indent=0]
----
====

Just like with the unidirectional `@OrderBy` list, the `number` column is used to order the statement on the SQL level.

When using the `@OrderColumn` annotation, the `order_id` column is going to be embedded in the child table:

[[collections-bidirectional-ordered-list-order-column-example]]
.Bidirectional `@OrderColumn` list
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/BidirectionalOrderColumnListTest.java[tags=collections-bidirectional-ordered-list-order-column-example,indent=0]
----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-bidirectional-ordered-list-order-column-example.sql[]
----
====

When fetching the collection, Hibernate will use the fetched ordered columns to sort the elements according to the `@OrderColumn` mapping.

[[collections-set]]
==== Sets

Sets are collections that don't allow duplicate entries and Hibernate supports both the unordered `Set` and the natural-ordering `SortedSet`.

[[collections-unidirectional-set]]
===== Unidirectional sets

The unidirectional set uses a link table to hold the parent-child associations and the entity mapping looks as follows:

[[collections-unidirectional-set-example]]
.Unidirectional set
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UnidirectionalSetTest.java[tags=collections-unidirectional-set-example,indent=0]
----
====

The unidirectional set lifecycle is similar to that of the <<collections-unidirectional-bag>>, so it can be omitted.
The only difference is that `Set` doesn't allow duplicates, but this constraint is enforced by the Java object contract rather then the database mapping.

[NOTE]
====
When using sets, it's very important to supply proper equals/hashCode implementations for child entities.
In the absence of a custom equals/hashCode implementation logic, Hibernate will use the default Java reference-based object equality which might render unexpected results when mixing detached and managed object instances.
====

[[collections-bidirectional-set]]
===== Bidirectional sets

Just like bidirectional bags, the bidirectional set doesn't use a link table, and the child table has a foreign key referencing the parent table primary key.
The lifecycle is just like with bidirectional bags except for the duplicates which are filtered out.

[[collections-bidirectional-set-example]]
.Bidirectional set
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/BidirectionalSetTest.java[tags=collections-bidirectional-set-example,indent=0]
----
====

[[collections-sorted-set]]
==== Sorted sets

For sorted sets, the entity mapping must use the `SortedSet` interface instead.
According to the `SortedSet` contract, all elements must implement the `Comparable` interface and therefore provide the sorting logic.

[[collections-unidirectional-sorted-set]]
===== Unidirectional sorted sets

A `SortedSet` that relies on the natural sorting order given by the child element `Comparable` implementation logic must be annotated with the `@SortNatural` Hibernate annotation.

[[collections-unidirectional-sorted-set-natural-comparator-example]]
.Unidirectional natural sorted set
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UnidirectionalSortedSetTest.java[tags=collections-unidirectional-sorted-set-natural-comparator-example,indent=0]
----
====

The lifecycle and the database mapping are identical to the <<collections-unidirectional-bag>>, so they are intentionally omitted.

To provide a custom sorting logic, Hibernate also provides a `@SortComparator` annotation:

[[collections-unidirectional-sorted-set-custom-comparator-example]]
.Unidirectional custom comparator sorted set
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/UnidirectionalComparatorSortedSetTest.java[tags=collections-unidirectional-sorted-set-custom-comparator-example,indent=0]
----
====

[[collections-bidirectional-sorted-set]]
===== Bidirectional sorted sets

The `@SortNatural` and `@SortComparator` work the same for bidirectional sorted sets too:

[[collections-bidirectional-sorted-set-example]]
.Bidirectional natural sorted set
====
[source,java]
----
include::{sourcedir}/BidirectionalSortedSetTest.java[tags=collections-bidirectional-sorted-set-example,indent=0]

include::{sourcedir}/UnidirectionalComparatorSortedSetTest.java[lines=75..77,indent=0]
----
====

[[collections-map]]
==== Maps

A `java.util.Map` is ternary association because it required a parent entity a map key and a value.
An entity can either be a map key or a map value, depending on the mapping.
Hibernate allows using the following map keys:

`MapKeyColumn`:: for value type maps, the map key is a column in the link table that defines the grouping logic
`MapKey`:: the map key is either the primary key or another property of the entity stored as a map entry value
`MapKeyEnumerated`:: the map key is an `Enum` of the target child entity
`MapKeyTemporal`:: the map key is a `Date` or a `Calendar` of the target child entity
`MapKeyJoinColumn`:: the map key is an entity mapped as an association in the child entity that's stored as a map entry key

[[collections-map-value-type]]
===== Value type maps

A map of value type must use the `@ElementCollection` annotation, just like value type lists, bags or sets.

[[collections-map-value-type-entity-key-example]]
.Value type map with an entity as a map key

----

[source,sql]
----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-map-value-type-entity-key-example.sql[]
----
====

Adding entries to the map generates the following SQL statements:

[[collections-map-value-type-entity-key-add-example]]

----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-map-value-type-entity-key-add-example.sql[]
----
====

[[collections-map-unidirectional]]
===== Unidirectional maps

A unidirectional map exposes a parent-child association from the parent-side only.
The following example shows a unidirectional map which also uses a `@MapKeyTemporal` annotation.
The map key is a timestamp and it's taken from the child entity table.

[[collections-map-unidirectional-example]]

----

----
include::{extrasdir}/collections-map-unidirectional-example.sql[]
----
====

[[collections-map-bidirectional]]
===== Bidirectional maps

Like most bidirectional associations, this relationship is owned by the child-side while the parent is the inverse side and can propagate its own state transitions to the child entities.
In the following example, you can see that `@MapKeyEnumerated` was used so that the `Phone` enumeration becomes the map key.

[[collections-map-bidirectional-example]]

----
====

[[collections-array]]
==== Arrays

When it comes to arrays, there is quite a difference between Java arrays and relational database array types (e.g. VARRAY, ARRAY).
First, not all database systems implement the SQL-99 ARRAY type, and, for this reason, Hibernate doesn't support native database array types.
Second, Java arrays are relevant for basic types only since storing multiple embeddables or entities should always be done using the Java Collection API.

[[collections-array-binary]]
==== Arrays as binary

By default, Hibernate will choose a BINARY type, as supported by the current `Dialect`.

[[collections-array-binary-example]]
.Binary arrays

----
====

[[collections-as-basic]]
==== Collections as basic value type

Notice how all the previous examples explicitly mark the collection attribute as either `ElementCollection`, `OneToMany` or `ManyToMany`.
Collections not marked as such require a custom Hibernate `Type` and the collection elements must be stored in a single database column.

This is sometimes beneficial. Consider a use-case such as a `VARCHAR` column that represents a delimited list/set of Strings.

[[collections-comma-delimited-collection-example]]
.Comma delimited collection

include::{sourcedir}/type/CommaDelimitedStringsType.java[tags=collections-comma-delimited-collection-example,indent=0]
----
====

The developer can use the comma-delimited collection like any other collection we've discussed so far and Hibernate will take care of the type transformation part.
The collection itself behaves like any other basic value type, as its lifecycle is bound to its owner entity.

[[collections-comma-delimited-collection-lifecycle-example]]

====

See the Hibernate Integrations Guide for more details on developing custom value type mappings.

[[collections-custom]]
==== Custom collection types

If you wish to use other collection types than `List`, `Set` or `Map`, like `Queue` for instance,
you have to use a custom collection type, as illustrated by the following example:

[[collections-custom-collection-mapping-example]]
.Custom collection mapping example

include::{sourcedir}/type/PersistentQueue.java[tags=collections-custom-collection-mapping-example,indent=0]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
The reason why the `Queue` interface is not used for the entity attribute is because Hibernate only allows the following types:

- `java.util.List`
- `java.util.Set`
- `java.util.Map`
- `java.util.SortedSet`
- `java.util.SortedMap`

However, the custom collection type can still be customized as long as the base type is one of the aformentioned persistent types.
====

This way, the `Phone` collection can be used as a `java.util.Queue`:
