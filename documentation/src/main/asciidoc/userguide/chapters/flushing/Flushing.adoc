== Flushing

Flushing is the process of synchronizing the state of the persistence context with the underlying database.
The `EntityManager` and the Hibernate `Session` expose a set of methods, through which the application developer can change the persistent state of an entity.

The persistence context acts as a transactional write-behind cache, queuing any entity state change.
Like any write-behind cache, changes are first applied in-memory and synchronized with the database during the flush time.
The flush operation takes every entity state change and translates it to an `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement.

[NOTE]
====
Because DML statements are grouped together, Hibernate can apply batching transparently.
See the <<chapters/batch/Batching.adoc#batch,Batching chapter>> for more information.
====

The flushing strategy is given by the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/Session.html#getFlushMode--[`flushMode`] of the current running Hibernate `Session`.
Although Jakarta Persistence defines only two flushing strategies ({jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}FlushModeType.html#AUTO[`AUTO`] and {jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}FlushModeType.html#COMMIT[`COMMIT`]),
Hibernate has a much broader spectrum of flush types:

ALWAYS:: Flushes the `Session` before every query.
AUTO:: This is the default mode, and it flushes the `Session` only if necessary.
COMMIT:: The `Session` tries to delay the flush until the current `Transaction` is committed, although it might flush prematurely too.
MANUAL:: The `Session` flushing is delegated to the application, which must call `Session.flush()` explicitly in order to apply the persistence context changes.

[[flushing-auto]]
=== `AUTO` flush

By default, Hibernate uses the `AUTO` flush mode which triggers a flush in the following circumstances:

* prior to committing a `Transaction`
* prior to executing a JPQL/HQL query that overlaps with the queued entity actions
* before executing any native SQL query that has no registered synchronization

==== `AUTO` flush on commit

In the following example, an entity is persisted, and then the transaction is committed.

Hibernate logs the message prior to inserting the entity because the flush only occurred during transaction commit.

[NOTE]
====
This is valid for the `SEQUENCE` and `TABLE` identifier generators.
The `IDENTITY` generator must execute the insert right after calling `persist()`.
For more details, see the discussion of generators in <<chapters/domain/identifiers.adoc#identifiers,_Identifier generators_>>.

==== `AUTO` flush on JPQL/HQL query

A flush may also be triggered when executing an entity query.

The reason why the `Advertisement` entity query didn't trigger a flush is that there's no overlapping between the `Advertisement` and the `Person` tables:

----
include::{example-dir-flushing}/AutoFlushTest.java[tags=flushing-auto-flush-jpql-entity-example]

====

When querying for a `Person` entity, the flush is triggered prior to executing the entity query.

[[flushing-auto-flush-jpql-overlap-example]]
.Automatic flushing on JPQL/HQL
====
[source, java, indent=0]

----

[source, sql, indent=0]
----
include::{extrasdir}/flushing-auto-flush-jpql-overlap-example.sql[]
----
====

This time, the flush was triggered by a JPQL query because the pending entity persisting action overlaps with the query being executed.

==== `AUTO` flush on native SQL query

When executing a native SQL query, a flush is always triggered when using the `EntityManager` API.

include::{example-dir-flushing}/AutoFlushTest.java[tags=flushing-auto-flush-sql-example]

If you bootstrap Hibernate natively, and not through Jakarta Persistence, by default,
the `Session` API will trigger a flush automatically when executing a native query.

To flush the `Session`, the query must use a synchronization:

[[flushing-commit]]
=== `COMMIT` flush

Jakarta Persistence also defines a COMMIT flush mode, which is described as follows:

[quote, Section 3.10.8 of the Java Persistence 2.1 Specification]
____
If `FlushModeType.COMMIT` is set, the effect of updates made to entities in the persistence context upon queries is unspecified.
____

When executing a JPQL query, the persistence context is only flushed when the current running transaction is committed.

----

----
====

Because the Jakarta Persistence doesn't impose a strict rule on delaying flushing, when executing a native SQL query, the persistence context is going to be flushed.

[[flushing-always]]
=== `ALWAYS` flush

[NOTE]
====
The `ALWAYS` is only available with the native `Session` API.
====

The `ALWAYS` flush mode triggers a persistence context flush even when executing a native SQL query against the `Session` API.

[[flushing-manual]]
=== `MANUAL` flush

Both the `EntityManager` and the Hibernate `Session` define a `flush()` method that, when called, triggers a manual flush.
Hibernate also provides a `MANUAL` flush mode so the persistence context can only be flushed manually.

[[flushing-manual-flush-example]]
.`MANUAL` flushing
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-flushing}/ManualFlushTest.java[tags=flushing-manual-flush-example]
----

[source, sql, indent=0]
----
include::{extrasdir}/flushing-manual-flush-example.sql[]
----
====

The `INSERT` statement was not executed because there was no manual `flush()` call.

[NOTE]
====
The `MANUAL` flush mode is useful when using multi-request logical transactions, and only the last request should flush the persistence context.
====

[[flushing-order]]
=== Flush operation order

From a database perspective, a row state can be altered using either an `INSERT`, an `UPDATE` or a `DELETE` statement.
Because entity state changes are automatically converted to SQL statements, it's important to know which entity actions are associated with a given SQL statement.

`INSERT`:: The `INSERT` statement is generated either by the `EntityInsertAction` or `EntityIdentityInsertAction`. These actions are scheduled by the `persist` operation, either explicitly or through cascading the `PersistEvent` from a parent to a child entity.
`DELETE`:: The `DELETE` statement is generated by the `EntityDeleteAction` or `OrphanRemovalAction`.
`UPDATE`:: The `UPDATE` statement is generated by `EntityUpdateAction` during flushing if the managed entity has been marked modified. The dirty checking mechanism is responsible for determining if a managed entity has been modified since it was first loaded.

Hibernate does not execute the SQL statements in the order of their associated entity state operations.

To visualize how this works, consider the following example:

[[flushing-order-example]]
.Flush operation order
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-flushing}/FlushOrderTest.java[tags=flushing-order-example]
----

[source, sql, indent=0]
----
include::{extrasdir}/flushing-order-example.sql[]
----
====

Even if we removed the first entity and then persist a new one, Hibernate is going to execute the `DELETE` statement after the `INSERT`.

[TIP]
====
The order in which SQL statements are executed is given by the `ActionQueue` and not by the order in which entity state operations have been previously defined.
====

The `ActionQueue` executes all operations in the following order:

. `OrphanRemovalAction`
. `EntityInsertAction` or `EntityIdentityInsertAction`
. `EntityUpdateAction`
. `QueuedOperationCollectionAction`
. `CollectionRemoveAction`
. `CollectionUpdateAction`
. `CollectionRecreateAction`
. `EntityDeleteAction`
