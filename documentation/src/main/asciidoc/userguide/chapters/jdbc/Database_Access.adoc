[[database-connectionprovider]]
=== ConnectionProvider

As an ORM tool, probably the single most important thing you need to tell Hibernate is how to connect to your database so that it may connect on behalf of your application.
This is ultimately the function of the `org.hibernate.engine.jdbc.connections.spi.ConnectionProvider` interface.
Hibernate provides some out of the box implementations of this interface.
`ConnectionProvider` is also an extension point so you can also use custom implementations from third parties or written yourself.
The `ConnectionProvider` to use is defined by the `hibernate.connection.provider_class` setting. See the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/cfg/AvailableSettings.html#CONNECTION_PROVIDER[`org.hibernate.cfg.AvailableSettings#CONNECTION_PROVIDER`]

Generally speaking, applications should not have to configure a `ConnectionProvider` explicitly if using one of the Hibernate-provided implementations.
Hibernate will internally determine which `ConnectionProvider` to use based on the following algorithm:

1. If `hibernate.connection.provider_class` is set, it takes precedence
2. else if `hibernate.connection.datasource` is set -> <<database-connectionprovider-datasource>>
3. else if any setting prefixed by `hibernate.c3p0.` is set -> <<database-connectionprovider-c3p0>>
4. else if any setting prefixed by `hibernate.hikari.` is set -> <<database-connectionprovider-hikari>>
5. else if any setting prefixed by `hibernate.agroal.` is set -> <<database-connectionprovider-agroal>>
6. else if `hibernate.connection.url` is set -> <<database-connectionprovider-drivermanager>>
7. else -> <<database-connectionprovider-provided>>

[[database-connectionprovider-datasource]]
=== Using DataSources

Hibernate can integrate with a `javax.sql.DataSource` for obtaining JDBC Connections.
Applications would tell Hibernate about the `DataSource` via the (required) `hibernate.connection.datasource` setting which can either specify a JNDI name or would reference the actual `DataSource` instance.
For cases where a JNDI name is given, be sure to read <<chapters/jndi/JNDI.adoc#jndi,JNDI>>.

[NOTE]
====
For Jakarta Persistence applications, note that `hibernate.connection.datasource` corresponds to
`jakarta.persistence.jtaDataSource` or `jakarta.persistence.nonJtaDataSource`.
====

The `DataSource` `ConnectionProvider` also (optionally) accepts the `hibernate.connection.username` and `hibernate.connection.password`.
If specified, the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/sql/DataSource.html#getConnection-java.lang.String-java.lang.String-[`DataSource#getConnection(String username, String password)`] will be used.
Otherwise, the no-arg form is used.

[[database-connectionprovider-driver]]
=== Driver Configuration
`hibernate.connection.driver_class`:: The name of the JDBC Driver class to use
`hibernate.connection.url`:: The JDBC connection url
`hibernate.connection.*`:: All such setting names (except the <<appendices/Configurations.adoc#configurations-database-connection,predefined ones>>) will have the `hibernate.connection.` prefix stripped. The remaining name and the original value will be passed to the driver as a JDBC connection property

NOTE: Not all properties apply to all situations. For example, if you are providing a data source, `hibernate.connection.driver_class` setting will not be used.

[[database-connectionprovider-c3p0]]
=== Using c3p0

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the c3p0 integration, the application must include the `hibernate-c3p0` module jar (as well as its dependencies) on the classpath.
====

Hibernate also provides support for applications to use https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/[c3p0] connection pooling.
When c3p0 support is enabled, a number of c3p0-specific configuration settings are recognized in addition to the general ones described in <<database-connectionprovider-driver>>.

Transaction isolation of the Connections is managed by the `ConnectionProvider` itself. See <<database-connectionprovider-isolation>>.

`hibernate.c3p0.min_size` or `c3p0.minPoolSize`:: The minimum size of the c3p0 pool. See https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#minPoolSize[c3p0 minPoolSize]
`hibernate.c3p0.max_size` or `c3p0.maxPoolSize`:: The maximum size of the c3p0 pool. See https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxPoolSize[c3p0 maxPoolSize]
`hibernate.c3p0.timeout` or `c3p0.maxIdleTime`:: The Connection idle time. See https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxIdleTime[c3p0 maxIdleTime]
`hibernate.c3p0.max_statements` or `c3p0.maxStatements`:: Controls the c3p0 PreparedStatement cache size (if using). See https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#maxStatements[c3p0 maxStatements]
`hibernate.c3p0.acquire_increment` or `c3p0.acquireIncrement`:: Number of connections c3p0 should acquire at a time when the pool is exhausted. See https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#acquireIncrement[c3p0 acquireIncrement]
`hibernate.c3p0.idle_test_period` or `c3p0.idleConnectionTestPeriod`:: Idle time before a c3p0 pooled connection is validated. See https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#idleConnectionTestPeriod[c3p0 idleConnectionTestPeriod]
`hibernate.c3p0.initialPoolSize`:: The initial c3p0 pool size. If not specified, default is to use the min pool size. See https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#initialPoolSize[c3p0 initialPoolSize]
Any other settings prefixed with `hibernate.c3p0.`:: Will have the `hibernate.` portion stripped and be passed to c3p0.
Any other settings prefixed with `c3p0.`:: Get passed to c3p0 as is. See https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/#configuration[c3p0 configuration]

[[database-connectionprovider-hikari]]
=== Using HikariCP

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the HikariCP this integration, the application must include the `hibernate-hikari` module jar (as well as its dependencies) on the classpath.
====

Hibernate also provides support for applications to use https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/[HikariCP] connection pool.

Set all of your Hikari settings in Hibernate prefixed by `hibernate.hikari.` and this `ConnectionProvider` will pick them up and pass them along to Hikari.
Additionally, this `ConnectionProvider` will pick up the following Hibernate-specific properties and map them to the corresponding Hikari ones (any `hibernate.hikari.` prefixed ones have precedence):

`hibernate.connection.driver_class`:: Mapped to Hikari's `driverClassName` setting
`hibernate.connection.url`:: Mapped to Hikari's `jdbcUrl` setting
`hibernate.connection.username`:: Mapped to Hikari's `username` setting
`hibernate.connection.password`:: Mapped to Hikari's `password` setting
`hibernate.connection.isolation`:: Mapped to Hikari's `transactionIsolation` setting. See <<ConnectionProvider support for transaction isolation setting>>.
Note that Hikari only supports JDBC standard isolation levels (apparently).
`hibernate.connection.autocommit`:: Mapped to Hikari's `autoCommit` setting

[[database-connectionprovider-agroal]]
=== Using Agroal

[IMPORTANT]
====
To use the Agroal integration, the application must include the `hibernate-agroal` module jar (as well as its dependencies) on the classpath.
====

Hibernate also provides support for applications to use https://agroal.github.io/[Agroal] connection pool.

Set all of your Agroal settings in Hibernate prefixed by `hibernate.agroal.` and this `ConnectionProvider` will pick them up and pass them along to Agroal connection pool.
Additionally, this `ConnectionProvider` will pick up the following Hibernate-specific properties and map them to the corresponding Agroal ones (any `hibernate.agroal.` prefixed ones have precedence):

`hibernate.connection.driver_class`:: Mapped to Agroal's `driverClassName` setting
`hibernate.connection.url`:: Mapped to Agroal's `jdbcUrl` setting
`hibernate.connection.username`:: Mapped to Agroal's `principal` setting
`hibernate.connection.password`:: Mapped to Agroal's `credential` setting
`hibernate.connection.isolation`:: Mapped to Agroal's `jdbcTransactionIsolation` setting. See <<ConnectionProvider support for transaction isolation setting>>.
`hibernate.connection.autocommit`:: Mapped to Agroal's `autoCommit` setting

[[database-connectionprovider-drivermanager]]
=== Using Hibernate's built-in (and unsupported) pooling

[IMPORTANT]
====
The built-in connection pool is not supported for use in a production system.
====

This section is here just for completeness.

[[database-connectionprovider-provided]]
=== User-provided Connections

It is possible to use Hibernate by simply passing a Connection to use to the Session when the Session is opened.
This usage is discouraged and not discussed here.

[[database-connectionprovider-isolation]]
=== ConnectionProvider support for transaction isolation setting

All the provided `ConnectionProvider` implementations, apart from `DataSourceConnectionProvider`, support consistent setting of transaction isolation for all `Connections` obtained from the underlying pool.
The value for `hibernate.connection.isolation` can be specified in one of 3 formats:

* the integer value accepted at the JDBC level.
* the name of the `java.sql.Connection` constant field representing the isolation you would like to use.
For example, `TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ` for https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html#TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ[`java.sql.Connection#TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ`].
Note that this is only supported for JDBC standard isolation levels, not for isolation levels specific to a particular JDBC driver.
* a short-name version of the java.sql.Connection constant field without the `TRANSACTION_` prefix. For example, `REPEATABLE_READ` for https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/sql/Connection.html#TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ[`java.sql.Connection#TRANSACTION_REPEATABLE_READ`].
Again, this is only supported for JDBC standard isolation levels, not for isolation levels specific to a particular JDBC driver.

[[database-connection-handling]]
=== Connection handling

The connection handling mode is defined by the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/resource/jdbc/spi/PhysicalConnectionHandlingMode.html[`PhysicalConnectionHandlingMode`] enumeration which provides the following strategies:

`IMMEDIATE_ACQUISITION_AND_HOLD`::
The `Connection` will be acquired as soon as the `Session` is opened and held until the `Session` is closed.
`DELAYED_ACQUISITION_AND_HOLD`::
The `Connection` will be acquired as soon as it is needed and then held until the `Session` is closed.
`DELAYED_ACQUISITION_AND_RELEASE_AFTER_STATEMENT`::
The `Connection` will be acquired as soon as it is needed and will be released after each statement is executed.
`DELAYED_ACQUISITION_AND_RELEASE_AFTER_TRANSACTION`::
The `Connection` will be acquired as soon as it is needed and will be released after each transaction is completed.

If you don't want to use the default connection handling mode, you can specify a connection handling mode via the `hibernate.connection.handling_mode` configuration property. For more details, check out the
<<appendices/Configurations.adoc#configurations-database-connection,Database connection properties>> section.

==== Transaction type and connection handling

By default, the connection handling mode is given by the underlying transaction coordinator. There are two types of transactions: `RESOURCE_LOCAL` (which involves a single database `Connection` and the transaction is controlled via the `commit` and `rollback` `Connection` methods) and `JTA` (which may involve multiple resources including database connections, JMS queues, etc).

===== RESOURCE_LOCAL transaction connection handling

For `RESOURCE_LOCAL` transactions, the connection handling mode is `DELAYED_ACQUISITION_AND_RELEASE_AFTER_TRANSACTION` meaning that the database connection is acquired when needed and released after the current running transaction is either committed or rolled back.

However, because Hibernate needs to make sure that the default autocommit mode is disabled on the JDBC `Connection`
when starting a new transaction, the `Connection` is acquired and the autocommit mode is set to `false`.

[NOTE]
====
If you are using a connection pool `DataSource` that already disabled the autocommit mode for every pooled `Connection`, you should set the `hibernate.connection.provider_disables_autocommit` to `true` and the database connection acquisition will be, indeed, delayed until Hibernate needs to execute the first SQL statement.
====

===== JTA transaction connection handling

For `JTA` transactions, the connection handling mode is `DELAYED_ACQUISITION_AND_RELEASE_AFTER_STATEMENT` meaning that the database connection is acquired when needed and released after each statement execution.

The reason for releasing the database connection after statement execution is because some Java EE application servers
report a connection leak when a method call goes from one EJB to another. However, even if the JDBC `Connection` is released to the pool, the `Connection` is still allocated to the current executing `Thread`, hence when executing a subsequent statement in the current running transaction, the same `Connection` object reference will be obtained from the pool.

[NOTE]
====
If the Java EE application server or JTA transaction manager supports switching from one EJB to another while the transaction gets propagated from the outer EJB to the inner one,
and no connection leak false positive is being reported, then you should consider switching to `DELAYED_ACQUISITION_AND_RELEASE_AFTER_TRANSACTION` via the `hibernate.connection.handling_mode` configuration property.
====

==== User-provided connections

If the current `Session` was created using the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/SessionBuilder.html[`SessionBuilder`] and a JDBC `Connection` was provided via the
https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/SessionBuilder.html#connection-java.sql.Connection-[`SessionBuilder#connection`] method, then the user-provided `Connection` is going to be used, and
the connection handling mode will be `IMMEDIATE_ACQUISITION_AND_HOLD`.

Therefore for user-provided connection, the connection is acquired right away and held until the current `Session` is closed, without being influenced by the Jakarta Persistence or Hibernate transaction context.

[[database-dialect]]
=== Database Dialect

Although SQL is now relatively standardized&mdash;much more so than in the past&mdash;it's still the case that each database vendor implements a different dialect of SQL that, while overlapping significantly with ANSI SQL, forms neither a subset, nor a superset, of the standard.

Hibernate abstracts over variations between dialects of SQL via the class `org.hibernate.dialect.Dialect`.

- There's a subclass of `Dialect` for each supported relational database in the package `org.hibernate.dialect`.
- Additional community-supported ``Dialect``s are available in the separate module `hibernate-community-dialects`.

In Hibernate 6, it's no longer necessary to explicitly specify a dialect using the configuration property `hibernate.dialect`, and so setting that property is now discouraged.
(An exception is the case of custom user-written ``Dialect``s.)
