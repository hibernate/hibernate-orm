Hibernate "grew up" not supporting bytecode enhancement at all.
At that time, Hibernate only supported proxy-based alternative for lazy loading and always used diff-based dirty calculation.
Hibernate 3.x saw the first attempts at bytecode enhancement support in Hibernate.
We consider those initial attempts (up until 5.0) completely as an incubation.
The support for bytecode enhancement in 5.0 onward is what we are discussing here.

See <<tooling-enhancement>> for discussion of performing enhancement.


[[BytecodeEnhancement-lazy-loading]]
==== Lazy attribute loading

Think of this as partial loading support.
Essentially, you can tell Hibernate that only part(s) of an entity should be loaded upon fetching from the database and when the other part(s) should be loaded as well.
Note that this is very much different from the proxy-based idea of lazy loading which is entity-centric where the entity's state is loaded at once as needed.
With bytecode enhancement, individual attributes or groups of attributes are loaded as needed.

Lazy attributes can be designated to be loaded together, and this is called a "lazy group".
By default, all singular attributes are part of a single group, meaning that when one lazy singular attribute is accessed all lazy singular attributes are loaded.
Lazy plural attributes, by default, are each a lazy group by themselves.
This behavior is explicitly controllable through the `@org.hibernate.annotations.LazyGroup` annotation.

In the above example, we have 2 lazy attributes: `accountsPayableXrefId` and `image`.
Each is part of a different fetch group (accountsPayableXrefId is part of the default fetch group),
which means that accessing `accountsPayableXrefId` will not force the loading of the `image` attribute, and vice-versa.

[NOTE]
====
As a hopefully temporary legacy hold-over, it is currently required that all lazy singular associations (many-to-one and one-to-one) also include `@LazyToOne(LazyToOneOption.NO_PROXY)`.
The plan is to relax that requirement later.

[[BytecodeEnhancement-dirty-tracking]]
==== In-line dirty tracking

Historically Hibernate only supported diff-based dirty calculation for determining which entities in a persistence context have changed.
This essentially means that Hibernate would keep track of the last known state of an entity in regards to the database (typically the last read or write).
Then, as part of flushing the persistence context, Hibernate would walk every entity associated with the persistence context and check its current state against that "last known database state".
This is by far the most thorough approach to dirty checking because it accounts for data-types that can change their internal state (`java.util.Date` is the prime example of this).
However, in a persistence context with a large number of associated entities, it can also be a performance-inhibiting approach.

If your application does not need to care about "internal state changing data-type" use cases, bytecode-enhanced dirty tracking might be a worthwhile alternative to consider, especially in terms of performance.
In this approach Hibernate will manipulate the bytecode of your classes to add "dirty tracking" directly to the entity, allowing the entity itself to keep track of which of its attributes have changed.
During the flush time, Hibernate asks your entity what has changed rather than having to perform the state-diff calculations.

[IMPORTANT]
Hibernate's extended bytecode enhancement feature has been deprecated, primarily because it relies on assumptions and behaviors that often require a broader runtime scope than what Hibernate alone can reliably provide, similar to container-based environments such as Quarkus or WildFly.
Applications which make use of this feature should instead use proper object-oriented encapsulation, exposing managed state via getters and setters.

[[BytecodeEnhancement-dirty-tracking-bidirectional]]
==== Bidirectional association management

Hibernate strives to keep your application as close to "normal Java usage" (idiomatic Java) as possible.
Consider a domain model with a normal `Person`/`Book` bidirectional association:

[[BytecodeEnhancement-dirty-tracking-bidirectional-example]]
.Bidirectional association

This blows up in normal Java usage. The correct normal Java usage is:

include::{example-dir-enhancement}/BytecodeEnhancementTest.java[tags=BytecodeEnhancement-dirty-tracking-bidirectional-correct-usage-example]

Bytecode-enhanced bi-directional association management makes that first example work by managing the "other side" of a bi-directional association whenever one side is manipulated.

[[BytecodeEnhancement-dirty-tracking-optimizations]]
==== Internal performance optimizations

Additionally, we use the enhancement process to add some additional code that allows us to optimize certain performance
characteristics of the persistence context.  These are hard to discuss without diving into a discussion of Hibernate internals.
