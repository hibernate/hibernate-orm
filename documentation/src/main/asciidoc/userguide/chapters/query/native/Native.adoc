You may also express queries in the native SQL dialect of your database.
This is useful if you want to utilize database-specific features such as window functions, Common Table Expressions (CTE) or the `CONNECT BY` option in Oracle.
It also provides a clean migration path from a direct SQL/JDBC based application to Hibernate/Jakarta Persistence.
Hibernate also allows you to specify handwritten SQL (including stored procedures) for all create, update, delete, and retrieve operations.

[[sql-jpa-query]]
=== Creating a native query using Jakarta Persistence

Execution of native SQL queries is controlled via the `NativeQuery` interface, which is obtained by calling `Session.createNativeQuery()`.
The following sections describe how to use this API for querying.

[[sql-scalar-query]]
=== Scalar queries

The most basic SQL query is to get a list of scalars (column) values.

[[sql-jpa-all-columns-scalar-query-example]]
.Jakarta Persistence native query selecting all columns

----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-jpa-all-columns-scalar-query-example]

====

----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-hibernate-custom-column-selection-scalar-query-example]
----
====

These will return a `List` of `Object` arrays ( `Object[]` ) with scalar values for each column in the `PERSON` table.
Hibernate will use `java.sql.ResultSetMetadata` to deduce the actual order and types of the returned scalar values.

To avoid the overhead of using `ResultSetMetadata`, or simply to be more explicit in what is returned, one can use `addScalar()`:

[[sql-hibernate-scalar-query-explicit-result-set-example]]
.Hibernate native query with explicit result set selection
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-hibernate-scalar-query-explicit-result-set-example]
----
====

Although it still returns an `Object` arrays, this query will not use the `ResultSetMetadata` anymore since it explicitly gets the `id` and `name` columns as respectively a `BigInteger` and a `String` from the underlying `ResultSet`.
This also means that only these two columns will be returned, even though the query is still using `*` and the `ResultSet` contains more than the three listed columns.

It is possible to leave out the type information for all or some of the scalars.

[[sql-hibernate-scalar-query-partial-explicit-result-set-example]]
.Hibernate native query with result set selection that's a partially explicit
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-hibernate-scalar-query-partial-explicit-result-set-example]
----
====

This is essentially the same query as before, but now `ResultSetMetaData` is used to determine the type of `name`, whereas the type of `id` is explicitly specified.

How the `java.sql.Types` returned from `ResultSetMetaData` is mapped to Hibernate types is controlled by the `Dialect`.
If a specific type is not mapped, or does not result in the expected type, it is possible to customize it via calls to `registerHibernateType` in the Dialect.

[[sql-entity-query]]
=== Entity queries

The above queries were all about returning scalar values, basically returning the _raw_ values from the `ResultSet`.

[[sql-jpa-entity-query-example]]
.Jakarta Persistence native query selecting entities

----
====

Assuming that `Person` is mapped as a class with the columns `id`, `name`, `nickName`, `address`, `createdOn`, and `version`,
the following query will also return a `List` where each element is a `Person` entity.

[[sql-jpa-entity-query-explicit-result-set-example]]
.Jakarta Persistence native query selecting entities with explicit result set
====
[source, java, indent=0]

----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-hibernate-entity-query-explicit-result-set-example]
----
====

[[sql-entity-associations-query]]
=== Handling associations and collections

If the entity is mapped with a `many-to-one` or a child-side `one-to-one` to another entity,
it is required to also return this when performing the native query,
otherwise, a database-specific _column not found_ error will occur.

[[sql-jpa-entity-associations-query-many-to-one-example]]
.Jakarta Persistence native query selecting entities with many-to-one association
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-jpa-entity-associations-query-many-to-one-example]

----

----
====

This will allow the `Phone#person` to function properly since the `many-to-one` or `one-to-one`
association is going to use a proxy that will be initialized when being navigated for the first time.

It is possible to eagerly join the `Phone` and the `Person` entities to avoid the possible extra round trip for initializing the `many-to-one` association.

[[sql-hibernate-entity-associations-query-many-to-one-join-example]]
.Hibernate native query selecting entities with joined many-to-one association

----
====

[NOTE]
====
As seen in the associated SQL query, Hibernate manages to construct the entity hierarchy without requiring any extra database round trips.
====

Even when using the `addJoin()` method, the result list will only contain the root entity.
Joined entities will only be present for their respective association.

====

Notice that you added an alias name _pr_ to be able to specify the target property path of the join.
It is possible to do the same eager joining for collections (e.g. the `Phone#calls` `one-to-many` association).

At this stage, you are reaching the limits of what is possible with native queries, without starting to enhance the sql queries to make them usable in Hibernate.
Problems can arise when returning multiple entities of the same type or when the default alias/column names are not enough.

[[sql-multi-entity-query]]
=== Returning multiple entities

Until now, the result set column names are assumed to be the same as the column names specified in the mapping document.
This can be problematic for SQL queries that join multiple tables since the same column names can appear in more than one table.

Column alias injection is needed in the following query which otherwise throws `NonUniqueDiscoveredSqlAliasException`.

[[sql-jpa-multi-entity-query-example]]
.Jakarta Persistence native query selecting entities with the same column names
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-jpa-multi-entity-query-example]
----
====

[[sql-hibernate-multi-entity-query-example]]
.Hibernate native query selecting entities with the same column names
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-hibernate-multi-entity-query-example]
----
====

The query was intended to return all `Person` and `Partner` instances with the same name.
The query fails because there is a conflict of names since the two entities are mapped to the same column names (e.g. `id`, `name`, `version`).
Also, on some databases, the returned column aliases will most likely be on the form `pr.id`, `pr.name`, etc.
which are not equal to the columns specified in the mappings (`id` and `name`).

The following form is not vulnerable to column name duplication:

[[sql-hibernate-multi-entity-query-alias-example]]
.Hibernate native query selecting entities with the same column names and aliases
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-hibernate-multi-entity-query-alias-example]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
There's no such equivalent in Jakarta Persistence because the `jakarta.persistence.Query` interface does not define an `addEntity` method equivalent.
====

The `{pr.*}` and `{pt.*}` notation used above is shorthand for "all properties".
Alternatively, you can list the columns explicitly, but even in this case, Hibernate injects the SQL column aliases for each property.
The placeholder for a column alias is just the property name qualified by the table alias.

[[sql-alias-references]]
=== Alias and property references

In most cases, the above alias injection is needed.
For queries relating to more complex mappings, like composite properties, inheritance discriminators, collections etc., you can use specific aliases that allow Hibernate to inject the proper aliases.

The following table shows the different ways you can use the alias injection.
Please note that the alias names in the result are simply examples, each alias will have a unique and probably different name when used.

.Alias injection names
[width="100%",cols="23%,22%,55%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Description |Syntax |Example
|A simple property |`{[aliasname].[propertyname]}`
|`A_NAME as {item.name}`

|A composite property |`{[aliasname].[componentname].[propertyname]}`
|`CURRENCY as {item.amount.currency}, VALUE as {item.amount.value}`

|Discriminator of an entity |`{[aliasname].class}`
|`DISC as {item.class}`

|All properties of an entity |`{[aliasname].*}` |`{item.*}`

|A collection key |`{[aliasname].key}` |`ORGID as {coll.key}`

|The id of a collection |`{[aliasname].id}` |`EMPID as {coll.id}`

|The element of a collection |`{[aliasname].element}`
|`XID as {coll.element}`

|property of the element in the collection
|`{[aliasname].element.[propertyname]}` |`NAME as {coll.element.name}`

|All properties of the element in the collection
|`{[aliasname].element.*}` |`{coll.element.*}`

|All properties of the collection |`{[aliasname].*}` |`{coll.*}`
|=======================================================================

[[sql-dto-query]]
=== Returning DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

It is possible to apply a `ResultTransformer` to native SQL queries, allowing it to return non-managed entities.

[[sql-hibernate-dto-query-example]]
.Hibernate native query selecting DTOs
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/PersonSummaryDTO.java[tags=sql-hibernate-dto-query-example, indent=0]

include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/SQLTest.java[tags=sql-hibernate-dto-query-example, indent=0]
----
====

[NOTE]
====
There's no such equivalent in Jakarta Persistence because the `jakarta.persistence.Query` interface does not define a `setResultTransformer` method equivalent.
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
When materializing a native query result as a polymorphic entity, it is important to understand that both the `JOINED` as well as the `TABLE_PER_CLASS` inheritance strategies require that the native query also include a special `clazz_` select item, which returns the subclass id that Hibernate needs to determine the concrete Java type for a row.

The subclass id is determined based on some order and the base class of the entity hierarchy has the number 0.

Refer to the respective sections in the inheritance chapter for examples of this.
====

The above query will return a list of `PersonSummaryDTO` which has been instantiated and injected the values of `id` and `name` into its corresponding properties or fields.

[[sql-inheritance-query]]
=== Handling inheritance

Native SQL queries which query for entities that are mapped as part of an inheritance must include all properties for the base class and all its subclasses.

[[sql-query-parameters]]
=== Parameters

Native SQL queries support ordinal as well as named parameters:

----
====

[[sql-named-queries]]
=== Named SQL queries

Named SQL queries can also be defined during mapping and called in exactly the same way as a named HQL query.
In this case, you do _not_ need to call `addEntity()` anymore.

Jakarta Persistence defines the `jakarta.persistence.NamedNativeQuery` annotation for this purpose,
and the Hibernate `org.hibernate.annotations.NamedNativeQuery` annotation extends it and adds the following attributes:

`flushMode()`::
	The flush mode for the query. By default, it uses the current Persistence Context flush mode.
`cacheable()`::
 	Whether the query (results) is cacheable or not. By default, queries are not cached.
`cacheRegion()`::
	If the query results are cacheable, name the query cache region to use.
`fetchSize()`::
	The number of rows fetched by the JDBC Driver per database trip. The default value is given by the JDBC driver.
`timeout()`::
	The query timeout (in seconds). By default, there's no timeout.
`callable()`::
	Does the SQL query represent a call to a procedure/function? The default is false.
`comment()`::
	A comment added to the SQL query for tuning the execution plan.
`cacheMode()`::
	The cache mode used for this query. This refers to entities/collections returned by the query.
	The default value is `CacheModeType.NORMAL`.
`readOnly()`::
	Whether the results should be read-only. By default, queries are not read-only so entities are stored in the Persistence Context.

[[sql-scalar-named-queries]]
==== Named SQL queries selecting scalar values

To fetch a single column of given table, the named query looks as follows:

Without specifying an explicit result type, Hibernate will assume an `Object` array:

You can also use the https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/{majorMinorVersion}/javadocs/org/hibernate/annotations/NamedNativeQuery.html[`@NamedNativeQuery`] Hibernate annotation

==== Named SQL queries selecting entities

Considering the following named query:

.Single-entity `NamedNativeQuery`
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-model}/Person.java[tags=sql-entity-NamedNativeQuery-example]
----
====

The result set mapping declares the entities retrieved by this native query.
Each field of the entity is bound to an SQL alias (or column name).
All fields of the entity including the ones of subclasses and the foreign key columns of related entities have to be present in the SQL query.
Field definitions are optional provided that they map to the same column name as the one declared on the class property.

Executing this named native query can be done as follows:

[[sql-jpa-entity-named-query-example]]
.Jakarta Persistence named native entity query

Finally, if the association to a related entity involves a composite primary key, a `@FieldResult` element should be used for each foreign key column.
The `@FieldResult` name is composed of the property name for the relationship, followed by a dot ("."), followed by the name or the field or property of the primary key.
For this example, the following entities are going to be used:

[[sql-global-catalog-schema]]
=== Resolving global catalog and schema in native SQL queries

When using multiple database catalogs and schemas, Hibernate offers the possibility of
setting a global catalog or schema so that you don't have to declare it explicitly for every entity.

[[sql-global-catalog-schema-configuration]]
.Setting global catalog and schema
====
[source, XML, indent=0]
----
<property name="hibernate.default_catalog" value="crm"/>
<property name="hibernate.default_schema" value="analytics"/>
----
====

This way, we can imply the global *crm* catalog and *analytics* schema in every JPQL, HQL or Criteria API query.

However, for native queries, the SQL query is passed as is, therefore you need to explicitly set the global catalog and schema whenever you are referencing a database table.
Fortunately, Hibernate allows you to resolve the current global catalog and schema using the following placeholders:

{h-catalog}:: resolves the current `hibernate.default_catalog` configuration property value.
{h-schema}:: resolves the current `hibernate.default_schema` configuration property value.
{h-domain}:: resolves the current `hibernate.default_catalog` and `hibernate.default_schema` configuration property values (e.g. catalog.schema).

With these placeholders, you can imply the catalog, schema, or both catalog and schema for every native query.

So, when running the following native query:

[source, java, indent=0]
----
@NamedNativeQuery(
    name = "last_30_days_hires",
    query =
        "select * " +
        "from {h-domain}person " +
        "where age(hired_on) < '30 days'",
    resultClass = Person.class
)
----

Hibernate is going to resolve the `{h-domain}` placeholder according to the values of the default catalog and schema:

[source, SQL, indent=0]
----
SELECT *
FROM   crm.analytics.person
WHERE  age(hired_on) < '30 days'
----

[[sql-sp]]
=== Using stored procedures for querying

Hibernate provides support for queries via stored procedures and functions.
A stored procedure arguments are declared using the `IN` parameter type, and the result can be either marked with an `OUT`
parameter type, a `REF_CURSOR` or it could just return the result like a function.

[[sql-sp-out-mysql-example]]
.MySQL stored procedure with `OUT` parameter type
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/MySQLStoredProcedureTest.java[tags=sql-sp-out-mysql-example]

====

To use this stored procedure, you can execute the following Jakarta Persistence query:

[[sql-jpa-call-sp-out-mysql-example]]
.Calling a MySQL stored procedure with `OUT` parameter type using Jakarta Persistence
====
[source, java, indent=0]

If the stored procedure outputs the result directly without an `OUT` parameter type:

[[sql-sp-mysql-return-no-out-example]]
.MySQL stored procedure without an `OUT` parameter type
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/MySQLStoredProcedureTest.java[tags=sql-sp-no-out-mysql-example]

For a `REF_CURSOR` result sets, we'll consider the following Oracle stored procedure:

[[sql-sp-ref-cursor-oracle-example]]
.Oracle `REF_CURSOR` stored procedure

----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/OracleStoredProcedureTest.java[tags=sql-sp-ref-cursor-oracle-example]
----
====

[IMPORTANT]
====
`REF_CURSOR` result sets are only supported by some relational databases (e.g. Oracle and PostgreSQL), and other database systems JDBC drivers might not support this feature.
====

This function can be called using the standard Java Persistence API:

If the database defines an SQL function:

.MySQL function
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/MySQLStoredProcedureTest.java[tags=sql-function-mysql-example]
----
====

Because the current `StoredProcedureQuery` implementation doesn't yet support SQL functions,
we need to use the JDBC syntax.

[NOTE]
====
This limitation is acknowledged and will be addressed by the https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-10530[HHH-10530] issue.

[NOTE]
====
Stored procedure queries cannot be paged with `setFirstResult()/setMaxResults()`.

Since these servers can return multiple result sets and update counts,
Hibernate will iterate the results and take the first result that is a result set as its return value, so everything else will be discarded.

For SQL Server, if you can enable `SET NOCOUNT ON` in your procedure it will probably be more efficient, but this is not a requirement.

[[sql-sp-named-query]]
=== Using named queries to call stored procedures

Just like with SQL statements, you can also use named queries to call stored procedures.
For this purpose, Jakarta Persistence defines the {jpaJavadocUrlPrefix}NamedStoredProcedureQuery.html[`@NamedStoredProcedureQuery`] annotation.

[[sql-sp-ref-cursor-oracle-named-query-example]]
.Oracle `REF_CURSOR` named query stored procedure
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{example-dir-model}/Person.java[tags=sql-sp-ref-cursor-oracle-named-query-example]

====

Calling this stored procedure is straightforward, as illustrated by the following example.

[[sql-crud]]
=== Custom SQL for CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete)

Hibernate can use custom SQL for CRUD operations.
The SQL can be overridden at the statement level or individual column level.
This section describes statement overrides.
For columns, see <<chapters/domain/basic_types.adoc#mapping-column-read-and-write,Column transformers: read and write expressions>>.

The following example shows how to define custom SQL operations using annotations.
`@SQLInsert`, `@SQLUpdate`, and `@SQLDelete` override the INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements of a given entity.
Similarly, `@SQLSelect` specifies a custom SELECT query used for loading the underlying table record.

For collections, Hibernate allows defining a custom `@SQLDeleteAll` which is used for removing all child records associated with a given parent entity.
To filter collections, the `@SQLRestriction` annotation allows customizing the underlying SQL WHERE clause.

.Custom CRUD
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/CustomSQLTest.java[tags=sql-custom-crud-example]
----
====

In the example above, the entity is mapped so that entries are soft-deleted (the records are not removed from the database, but instead, a flag marks the row validity).
The `Person` entity benefits from custom INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements which update the `valid` column accordingly.
The custom `@SQLSelect` is used to retrieve only `Person` rows that are valid.

The same is done for the `phones` collection. The `@SQLDeleteAll` and the `SQLInsert` queries are used whenever the collection is modified.

[NOTE]
====
You can also call a store procedure using the custom CRUD statements.
The only requirement is to set the `callable` attribute to `true`.
====

To check that the execution happens correctly, Hibernate allows you to define one of those three strategies:

* none: no check is performed; the store procedure is expected to fail upon constraint violations.
* count: use of row-count returned by the `executeUpdate()` method call to check that the update was successful.
* param: like count but using a `CallableStatement` output parameter.

To define the result check style, use the `check` parameter.

[TIP]
====
The parameter order is important and is defined by the order Hibernate handles properties.
You can see the expected order by enabling debug logging, so Hibernate can print out the static SQL that is used to create, update, delete entities.

To see the expected sequence, remember to not include your custom SQL through annotations or mapping files as that will override the Hibernate generated static SQL.
====

Overriding SQL statements for secondary tables is also possible.

----
====

[TIP]
====
The SQL is directly executed in your database, so you can use any dialect you like.
This will, however, reduce the portability of your mapping if you use database-specific SQL.
====

You can also use stored procedures for customizing the CRUD statements.

Assuming the following stored procedure:

[[sql-sp-soft-delete-example]]
.Oracle stored procedure to soft-delete a given entity
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
include::{doc-emeddable-example-dir}/OracleCustomSQLWithStoredProcedureTest.java[tags=sql-sp-soft-delete-example]
----
====

The entity can use this stored procedure to soft-delete the entity in question:

[NOTE]
====
You need to set the `callable` attribute when using a stored procedure instead of an SQL statement.
