[[QuerySpecification]]
== Programmatic Query Specification
:root-project-dir: ../../../../../../../..

Hibernate offers an API for creating a representation of a query, adjusting that representation programmatically, and then creating an executable form of the query.  The idea is similar in concept to <<chapters/query/criteria/Criteria.adoc#criteria,criteria queries>>, but focused on ease-of-use and less verbosity.

There is support for both <<SelectionSpecification,selection>> and <<MutationSpecification,mutation>> queries via the `SelectionSpecification` and `MutationSpecification` contracts, respectively.  These can be obtained from both `Session` and `StatelessSession`.

[NOTE]
====
These APIs are new in 7.0 and considered incubating.

[[SelectionSpecification]]
=== SelectionSpecification

A `SelectionSpecification` allows to iteratively build a query from a "base", adjust the query by adding sorting and restrictions and finally creating an executable <<hql-SelectionQuery,`SelectionQuery`>>.  We can use HQL as the base -

.SelectionSpecification from HQL
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
SelectionSpecification<Book> spec = session.createSelectionSpecification(
    "from Book",
    Book.class
);
----
====

or a root entity as the base -

.SelectionSpecification from root entity
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
SelectionSpecification<Book> spec = session.createSelectionSpecification(Book.class);
----
====

Once we have the `SelectionSpecification` we can adjust the query adding restrictions and sorting -

.Adjusting the SelectionSpecification
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
// from here we can augment the base query "from Book",
// with either restrictions
spec.restriction(
    Restriction.restrict(
        Book_.suggestedCost,
        Range.closed(10.00, 19.99)
    )
);

// or here with some sorting
spec.order(
    Order.asc(Book_.suggestedCost)
)
----
====

[NOTE]
====
Notice that generally the JPA static metamodel is a convenient and type-safe way to help build these sorting and restriction references.
====

After adjusting the query, we can obtain the executable `SelectionQuery`:

.Using the SelectionSpecification
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
SelectionQuery<Book> qry = ds.createQuery();
List<Book> books = qry.getResultList();
----
====

These calls can even be chained, e.g.

.Example of chained calls
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
SelectionQuery<Book> qry = session.createSelectionSpecification(
    "from Book",
    Book.class
).restriction(
    Restriction.restrict(
        Book_.suggestedCost,
        Range.closed(10.00, 19.99)
    )
).order(
    Order.asc(Book_.suggestedCost)
).createQuery();
----
====

[NOTE]
====
We expect, in future releases, to add the ability to handle pagination.

We also expect to add the ability to use <<criteria,Criteria>> references as the base.  Possibly even `TypedQueryReference` references.
====

[[MutationSpecification]]
=== MutationSpecification

There is also support for mutation queries through `MutationSpecification`.
At the moment, only update and delete queries are supported.  E.g.

.MutationQuery example
====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
MutationQuery<Book> qry = session.createMutationSpecification(
    "delete Book",
    Book.class
).restriction(
    Restriction.restrict(
        Book_.suggestedCost,
        Range.closed(10.00, 19.99)
    )
).createQuery();
