[[tooling-maven]]
=== Maven

The following sections illustrate how both <<tooling-maven-enhancement,bytecode enhancement>> and <<tooling-maven-modelgen,metamodel generation>> capabilities can be integrated into Maven builds.

[[tooling-maven-enhancement]]
==== Bytecode Enhancement

Hibernate provides a https://maven.apache.org/[Maven] plugin capable of providing
build-time enhancement of the domain model as they are compiled as part of a Maven
build.  See the section on <<BytecodeEnhancement>> for details
on the configuration settings.  By default, all enhancements are disabled.

[[tooling-maven-modelgen]]
==== Static Metamodel Generation

The recommended way to integrate the metamodel generation into a maven project is through the annotation processor paths of the maven compiler plugin (roughly equivalent to how the generator is integrated in a gradle project).
