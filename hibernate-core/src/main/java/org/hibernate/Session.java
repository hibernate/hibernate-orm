/**
 * The main runtime interface between a Java application and Hibernate. Represents the
 * notion of a <em>persistence context</em>, a set of managed entity instances associated
 * with a logical transaction.
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of a {@code Session} is bounded by the beginning and end of the logical
 * transaction. But a long logical transaction might span several database transactions.
 * <p>
 * The primary purpose of the {@code Session} is to offer create, read, and delete
 * operations for instances of mapped entity classes. An instance may be in one of three
 * states with respect to a given open session:
 * <ul>
 * <li><em>transient:</em> never persistent, and not associated with the {@code Session},
 * <li><em>persistent:</em> currently associated with the {@code Session}, or
 * <li><em>detached:</em> previously persistent, but not currently associated with the
 *     {@code Session}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Each persistent instance has a <em>persistent identity</em> determined by its type
 * and identifier value. There may be at most one persistent instance with a given
 * persistent identity associated with a given session. A persistent identity is
 * assigned when an {@linkplain #persist(Object) instance is made persistent}.
 * <p>
 * An instance of an entity class may be associated with at most one open session.
 * Distinct sessions represent state with the same persistent identity using distinct
 * persistent instances of the mapped entity class.
 * <p>
 * Any instance returned by {@link #get(Class, Object)}, {@link #find(Class, Object)},
 * or by a query is persistent. A persistent instance might hold references to other
 * entity instances, and sometimes these references are <em>proxied</em> by an
 * intermediate object. When an associated entity has not yet been fetched from the
 * database, references to the unfetched entity are represented by uninitialized
 * proxies. The state of an unfetched entity is automatically fetched from the
 * database when a method of its proxy is invoked, if and only if the proxy is
 * associated with an open session. Otherwise, {@link #getReference(Object)} may be
 * used to trade a proxy belonging to a closed session for a new proxy associated
 * with the current session.
 * <p>
 * A transient instance may be made persistent by calling {@link #persist(Object)}.
 * A persistent instance may be made detached by calling {@link #detach(Object)}.
 * A persistent instance may be marked for removal, and eventually made transient,
 * by calling {@link #remove(Object)}.
 * <p>
 * Persistent instances are held in a managed state by the persistence context. Any
 * change to the state of a persistent instance is automatically detected and eventually
 * flushed to the database. This process of automatic change detection is called
 * <em>dirty checking</em> and can be expensive in some circumstances. Dirty checking
 * may be disabled by marking an entity as read-only using
 * {@link #setReadOnly(Object, boolean)} or simply by {@linkplain #detach(Object) evicting}
 * it from the persistence context. A session may be set to load entities as read-only
 * {@linkplain #setDefaultReadOnly(boolean) by default}, or this may be controlled at the
 * {@linkplain Query#setReadOnly(boolean) query level}.
 * <p>
 * The state of a transient or detached instance may be made persistent by copying it to
 * a persistent instance using {@link #merge(Object)}. All older operations which moved a
 * detached instance to the persistent state are now deprecated, and clients should now
 * migrate to the use of {@code merge()}.
 * <p>
 * The persistent state of a managed entity may be refreshed from the database, discarding
 * all modifications to the object held in memory, by calling {@link #refresh(Object)}.
 * <p>
 * From {@linkplain FlushMode time to time}, a {@linkplain #flush() flush operation} is
 * triggered, and the session synchronizes state held in memory with persistent state
 * held in the database by executing SQL {@code insert}, {@code update}, and {@code delete}
 * statements. Note that SQL statements are often not executed synchronously by the methods
 * of the {@code Session} interface. If synchronous execution of SQL is desired, the
 * {@link StatelessSession} allows this.
 * <p>
 * Each managed instance has an associated {@link LockMode}. By default, the session
 * obtains only {@link LockMode#READ} on an entity instance it reads from the database
 * and {@link LockMode#WRITE} on an entity instance it writes to the database. This
 * behavior is appropriate for programs which use optimistic locking.
 * <ul>
 * <li>A different lock level may be obtained by explicitly specifying the mode using
 *     {@link #get(Class, Object, LockMode)}, {@link #find(Class, Object, LockModeType)},
 *     {@link #refresh(Object, LockMode)}, {@link #refresh(Object, LockModeType)}, or
 *     {@link org.hibernate.query.SelectionQuery#setLockMode(LockModeType)}.
 * <li>The lock level of a managed instance already held by the session may be upgraded
 *     to a more restrictive lock level by calling {@link #lock(Object, LockMode)} or
 *     {@link #lock(Object, LockModeType)}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A persistence context holds hard references to all its entities and prevents them
 * from being garbage collected. Therefore, a {@code Session} is a short-lived object,
 * and must be discarded as soon as a logical transaction ends. In extreme cases,
 * {@link #clear()} and {@link #detach(Object)} may be used to control memory usage.
 * However, for processes which read many entities, a {@link StatelessSession} should
 * be used.
 * <p>
 * A session might be associated with a container-managed JTA transaction, or it might be
 * in control of its own <em>resource-local</em> database transaction. In the case of a
 * resource-local transaction, the client must demarcate the beginning and end of the
 * transaction using a {@link Transaction}. A typical resource-local transaction should
 * use the following idiom:
 * <pre>
 * Session session = factory.openSession();
 * Transaction tx = null;
 * try {
 *     tx = session.beginTransaction();
 *     //do some work
 *     ...
 *     tx.commit();
 * }
 * catch (Exception e) {
 *     if (tx!=null) tx.rollback();
 *     throw e;
 * }
 * finally {
 *     session.close();
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * It's crucially important to appreciate the following restrictions and why they exist:
 * <ul>
 * <li>If the {@code Session} throws an exception, the current transaction must be rolled
 *     back and the session must be discarded. The internal state of the {@code Session}
 *     cannot be expected to be consistent with the database after the exception occurs.
 * <li>At the end of a logical transaction, the session must be explicitly {@linkplain
 *     #close() destroyed}, so that all JDBC resources may be released.
 * <li>A {@code Session} is never thread-safe. It contains various different sorts of
 *     fragile mutable state. Each thread or transaction must obtain its own dedicated
 *     instance from the {@link SessionFactory}.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An easy way to be sure that session and transaction management is being done correctly
 * is to {@linkplain SessionFactory#inTransaction(Consumer) let the factory do it}:
 * <pre>
 * sessionFactory.inTransaction(session -&gt; {
 *     //do the work
 *     ...
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * A session may be used to {@linkplain #doWork(Work) execute JDBC work} using its JDBC
 * connection and transaction:
 * <pre>
 * session.doWork(connection -&gt; {
 *     try ( PreparedStatement ps = connection.prepareStatement( " ... " ) ) {
 *         ps.execute();
 *     }
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * A {@code Session} instance is serializable if its entities are serializable.
 * <p>
 * Every {@code Session} is a JPA {@link EntityManager}. Furthermore, when Hibernate is
 * acting as the JPA persistence provider, the method {@link EntityManager#unwrap(Class)}
 * may be used to obtain the underlying {@code Session}.
 * <p>
 * Hibernate, unlike JPA, allows a persistence unit where an entity class is mapped multiple
 * times, with different entity names, usually to different tables. In this case, the session
 * needs a way to identify the entity name of a given instance of the entity class. Therefore,
 * some operations of this interface, including operations inherited from {@code EntityManager},
 * are overloaded with a form that accepts an explicit entity name along with the instance. An
 * alternative solution to this problem is to provide an {@link EntityNameResolver}.
