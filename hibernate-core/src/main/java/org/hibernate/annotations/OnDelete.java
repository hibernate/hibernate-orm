/**
 * Specifies an {@code on delete} action for a foreign key constraint.
 * The most common usage is {@code @OnDelete(action = CASCADE)}.
 * <pre>
 * &#064;ManyToOne
 * &#064;OnDelete(action = CASCADE)
 * Parent parent;
 * </pre>
 * Note that this results in an {@code on delete cascade} clause in
 * the DDL definition of the foreign key. It's completely different
 * to {@link jakarta.persistence.CascadeType#REMOVE}.
 * <p>
 * In fact, {@code @OnDelete} may be combined with {@code cascade=REMOVE}.
 * <pre>
 * &#064;ManyToOne(cascade = REMOVE)
 * &#064;OnDelete(action = CASCADE)
 * Parent parent;
 * </pre>
 * <ul>
 * <li>If {@code @OnDelete(action = CASCADE)} is used in conjunction
 *     with {@code cascade=REMOVE}, then associated entities are fetched
 *     from the database, marked deleted in the persistence context,
 *     and evicted from the second-level cache.
 * <li>If {@code @OnDelete(action = CASCADE)} is used on its own,
 *     <em>without</em> {@code cascade=REMOVE}, then associated
 *     entities are not fetched from the database, are not marked
 *     deleted in the persistence context, and are not automatically
 *     evicted from the second-level cache.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Like database triggers, {@code on delete} actions can cause state
 * held in memory to lose synchronization with the database.
