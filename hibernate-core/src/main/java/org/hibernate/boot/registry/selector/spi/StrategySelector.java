/**
 * Service which acts as a registry for named strategy implementations.
 * <p>
 * Strategies are more open-ended than services, though a strategy managed here might very well also be a service.
 * The strategy is any interface that has multiple, (possibly short) named implementations.
 * <p>
 * {@code StrategySelector} manages resolution of particular implementation by (possibly short) name via the
 * {@link #selectStrategyImplementor} method, which is the main contract here.  As indicated in the docs of that
 * method the given name might be either a short registered name or the implementation FQN.  As an example, consider
 * resolving the {@link org.hibernate.resource.transaction.spi.TransactionCoordinatorBuilder} implementation to use.
 * To use the JDBC-based {@code TransactionCoordinatorBuilder} the passed name might be either {@code "jdbc"} or
 * {@code "org.hibernate.resource.transaction.backend.jdbc.internal.JdbcResourceLocalTransactionCoordinatorBuilderImpl"}.
 * <p>
 * Strategy implementations can be managed by {@link #registerStrategyImplementor} and {@link #unRegisterStrategyImplementor}.
 * Originally designed to help the OSGi use case, though no longer used there.
 * <p>
 * The service also exposes a general typing API via {@link #resolveStrategy} and {@link #resolveDefaultableStrategy}
 * which accept implementation references rather than implementation names, allowing for a multitude of interpretations
 * of said "implementation reference".  See the docs for {@link #resolveDefaultableStrategy} for details.
