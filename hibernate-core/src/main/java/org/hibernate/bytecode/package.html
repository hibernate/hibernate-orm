			This package defines the API for plugging in bytecode libraries
			for usage by Hibernate.  Hibernate uses these bytecode libraries
			in three scenarios:<ol>
				<li>
					<b>Reflection optimization</b> - to speed up the performance of
					POJO entity and component conctruction and field/property access
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Proxy generation</b> - runtime building of proxies used for
					deferred loading of lazy entities
				</li>
				<li>
					<b>Field-level interception</b> - build-time instrumentation of entity
					classes for the purpose of intercepting field-level access (read/write)
					for both lazy loading and dirty tracking.
				</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that for field-level interception, simply plugging in a new {@link BytecodeProvider}
			is not enough for Hibernate to be able to recognize new providers.  You would additionally
			need to make appropriate code changes to the {@link org.hibernate.intercept.Helper}
			class.  This is because the detection of these enhanced classes is needed in a static
			environment (i.e. outside the scope of any {@link org.hibernate.SessionFactory}.
		</p>
		<p>
			Note that in the current form the ability to specify a different bytecode provider
			is actually considered a global settings (global to the JVM).
