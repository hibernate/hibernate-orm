 * (as maintaining a proper cache implementation is not at all trivial) and allows for people to experiment with
 * various algorithms, including state-of-the-art that we might not be familiar with.
 * For these reasons, we rely on this internal interface and encourage plugging in an external implementation;
 * at the time of writing this we'll have a legacy implementation for backwards compatibility reasons but the general
 * idea is to deprecate it and eventually require a third party implementation.
