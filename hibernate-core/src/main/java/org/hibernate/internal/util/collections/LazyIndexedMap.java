/**
 * This is an internal data structure designed for very specific needs;
 * it will most often be used as a replacement for EnumMap, although
 * the focus on the Enum aspect is modelled as an int primitive:
 * think of using the ordinals of an Enum to simulate the EnumMap.
 * Proper abstraction of the indexing strategy is left to subclasses.
 * <p>
 * There are various reasons to not expose the Enum on this class API;
 * the primary is that in some of the cases in which we need the pattern,
 * there is the need to hold an additional couple of values beyond the
 * ones modelled by the Enum, essentially having some extra keys in the map;
 * this could be modelled by defining a new Enum but that's also not ideal.
 * <p>
 * Another reason is that the goal of this class is to allow the host to
 * save memory, as we typically need to keep references to many of these
 * objects for a long time; being able to refer purely to an array is
 * less practical but gets us benefits in memory layout and total retained
 * memory.
 *
 * @param <K> the types used to model the key
 * @param <V> the types used to model the value
