Things to fix after JPA 4.0 gets a named release

== JPA Dependency

=== settings.gradle

* temporarily commented out `if` statement for using Jakarta snapshot repo (~ line 33).  Fix this after spec goes final.
* `jpaVersion` set to 4.0.0-SNAPSHOT


=== JpaVersion (local-build-plugins)

Changed `DEFAULT_VERSION` to 4.0

=== Maven plugin integration testing

Re-enable `:hibernate-maven-plugin:integrationTest`
