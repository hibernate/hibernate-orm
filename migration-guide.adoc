This guide discusses migration to Hibernate ORM version {version}. For migration from
earlier versions, see any other pertinent migration guides as well.

This section describes changes to contracts (classes, interfaces, methods, etc.) which are considered https://hibernate.org/community/compatibility-policy/#api[API].

[[spi-changes]]
== Changes to SPI

This section describes changes to contracts (classes, interfaces, methods, etc.) which are considered https://hibernate.org/community/compatibility-policy/#spi[SPI].

[[registry-generic-signatures]]
=== Registry Generic Signatures

Some operations of `TypeConfiguration`, `JavaTypeRegistry`, and `BasicTypeRegistry` had previously used unbound type parameters in the return type. The generic signatures of these methods have been changed for improved type safety.


[[AzureSQLServerDialect]]
=== AzureSQLServerDialect Deprecation

`org.hibernate.dialect.AzureSQLServerDialect` was deprecated; use `org.hibernate.dialect.SQLServerDialect` instead.

[IMPORTANT]
====
If you set `hibernate.boot.allow_jdbc_metadata_access=false` for offline startup,
remember to also set the targeted database version through `jakarta.persistence.database-product-version` - this would be 16.0 for SQL Server 2022 or 17.0 for SQL Server 2025.

// Changes in Behavior

[[behavior-changes]]
== Changes in Behavior

[[child-session-flush-close]]
=== Child Session Flush/Close Behavior

`Session` and `StatelessSession` which share transactional context with a parent now have slightly different semantics in regard to flushing and closing -

* when the parent is flushed, the child is flushed
* when the parent is closed, the child is closed

[NOTE]
====
This led to a change in triggering of flush events for both -

* `SessionEventListener` registrations
* JFR events

In both cases, the events are now triggered regardless of whether any entities or collections were actually flushed.
Each already carried the number of entities and the number of collections which were actually flushed.
Previously, when no entities and no collections were flushed to the database no event was generated; the event is now generated and both values will be zero.

Interestingly, this now also aligns with handling for auto-flush events which already always triggered these events.
====


[[child-session-no-interceptor]]
=== Child Session No-Interceptor Behavior

The behavior of `noInterceptor()` for `SharedSessionBuilder` and (the new) `SharedStatelessSessionBuilder` was aligned with the preexisting semantics of this method on `SessionBuilder` and `StatelessSessionBuilder`.
The previous behavior may be recovered by calling `noSessionInterceptorCreation()`.

[[test-util-bytecodeenhanced-engine]]
=== JUnit `BytecodeEnhancedTestEngine`

With this version, `BytecodeEnhancedTestEngine` will be disabled by default.
To be able to run the tests annotated with `@BytecodeEnhanced`, this engine has to be explicitly enabled via a system property:

[source, properties]
----
hibernate.testing.bytecode.enhancement.extension.engine.enabled=true
----

For a Maven-based project this can be done as part of the failsafe/surefire plugin configuration:

[source, xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <systemPropertyVariables>
            <hibernate.testing.bytecode.enhancement.extension.engine.enabled>true</hibernate.testing.bytecode.enhancement.extension.engine.enabled>
            <!-- Any other system properties required by your tests -->
        </systemPropertyVariables>
        <!-- The rest of the testing plugin configuration -->
        <!-- ... -->
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

While for a Gradle-based project this can be done in multiple ways, it essentially comes down to configuring the
link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test.html#org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.Test:systemProperties[`systemProperties`]
of a `Test` task:

[source, groovy]
----
tasks.withType(Test.class) {
    // Enable bytecode enhanced engine:
    systemProperties.systemProperties['hibernate.testing.bytecode.enhancement.extension.engine.enabled'] = true
    // Any other test task configurations
    // ...
}
----

Also, this engine is expected to only work with the exact version of JUnit that `org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-testing` depends on.
While it may work with other versions as well, there is no guarantee of that.

// DDL changes
// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[[ddl-changes]]
== Changes to DDL generation

This section describes changes to DDL generated by the schema export tooling.
Such changes typically do not impact programs using a relational schema managed externally to Hibernate.


[[dependency-changes]]
== Changes in Dependencies

This section describes changes to dependencies used by Hibernate ORM.

[[junit6]]
=== JUnit 6 update

Hibernate ORM test utils distributed as `org.hibernate.orm:hibernate-testing` are now based on JUnit 6.0.
In general, this update is compatible with previous JUnit 5 versions unless the tests depended on the
<<test-util-bytecodeenhanced-engine,@BytecodeEnhanced extension>>.
