6.4 adds some cool new features, in addition to many improvements and fixes.

[[soft-delete]]
== Soft Delete


6.4 adds support for soft deletes using the new `@SoftDelete` annotation.

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@SoftDelete
class Account {
	...
}
----

Dealing with values as deleted/non-deleted versus active/inactive (reversed) is simple using an annotation attribute:

This has the ability to easily handle active v. deleted tracking using a simple annotation attribute:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@SoftDelete(strategy=ACTIVE)
class Account {
	...
}
----

It even supports pluggable converters for storing the indicator value into the database.strategy

See the link:{userGuideBase}#soft-delete[User Guide] for details.
