Describes the new features and capabilities added to Hibernate ORM in 7.0.

If migrating from 6.6, be sure to also check out the link:{migrationGuide}[Migration Guide] for discussion of impactful changes.

[[relicense]]
== Apache License

Starting with 7.0, Hibernate ORM will be licensed under the Apache License 2.0.

Details can be seen at https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-19145.

As part of this effort, the Hibernate team reached out to the authors of
"non-trivial" contributions to request permission to relicense their
work under the Apache License.  The response was overwhelming positive, although
we never heard back from some contributors and another explicitly disagreed.
This required a few actions on our part:

* Dropping `hibernate-ucp` - see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-19162
* Dropping `TeradataDialect` - see https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-19057

[[java-17]]
== Java 17

Java 17 is the new baseline Java version.


[[jpa-32]]
== Jakarta Persistence 3.2

7.0 migrates to Jakarta Persistence 3.2, which is fairly disruptive.
See this https://in.relation.to/2024/04/01/jakarta-persistence-3/[blog post] for a good discussion of the changes.

[[hibernate-models]]
== Hibernate Models

For many years Hibernate has used the Hibernate Commons Annotations (HCANN) library for handling various low-level tasks
related to understanding the structure of an application domain model, reading annotations and weaving in XML
mapping documents.
The https://github.com/hibernate/hibernate-models[Hibernate Models] project was developed to be a better alternative
to HCANN.
7.0 uses Hibernate Models in place of HCANN.

[[soft-delete-timestamp]]
== @SoftDelete with TIMESTAMP

Soft-delete now supports the strategy of tracking the timestamp at which the soft-delete occurred,
in addition to the previous truth-based strategies.
See the link:{userGuideBase}#soft-delete[User Guide] for details.

[[embedded-column-naming]]
== @EmbeddedColumnNaming

A long-requested feature for both Hibernate and Jakarta Persistence has been the ability to
define a prefix for the names of columns associated with an embedded value.

7.0 adds support for this using the new `@EmbeddedColumnNaming` annotation.  The annotation
accepts a format pattern, so is more flexible than just a prefix.

[source,java]
----
@Embeddable
class Address {
    String street;
    String city;
	...
}

@Entity
class Person {
    ...
    @Embedded
    @EmbeddedColumnNaming("home_%")
    Address homeAddress;

    @Embedded
    @EmbeddedColumnNaming("work_%")
    Address workAddress;
}
----

[NOTE]
====
This feature is considered incubating.
====

See the link:{userGuideBase}#embeddable-column-naming[User Guide] for details.


[[NamedEntityGraph]]
== @NamedEntityGraph

A new annotation (`@org.hibernate.annotations.NamedEntityGraph`) has been added to allow
specifying a named entity-graph using Hibernate's ability to parse a string representation of the graph.


[source,java]
----
@Entity
@NamedEntityGraph( graph="title, isbn, author(name, phoneNumber)" )
class Book {
	// ...
}
----


See `org.hibernate.graph.GraphParser` for details on the syntax and the
link:{userGuideBase}#fetching-strategies-dynamic-fetching-entity-graph-parsing-annotation[User Guide] for additional details.


[[session-find-multiple]]
== findMultiple() and getMultiple()

The new operations `Session.findMultiple()` and `StatelessSession.getMultiple()` provide a convenient way to fetch a batch of entities by id.
Combined with the `BatchSize` option, allows breaking up the JDBC calls into "batches".


[[operation-options]]
== FindOption, LockOption, RefreshOption

As a more typesafe replacement for hints, Jakarta Persistence now allows for "option objects" which indicate these hints.  Not only is it more typesafe, but also more concise - a double win!

These "option objects" come in 3 flavors depending on what operation is being performed -

FindOption:: Used to indicate options for find operations :
    * `Session.find`
    * `Session.findMultiple`
    * etc
LockOption:: Used to indicate options for `Session.lock`
RefreshOption:: Used to indicate options for `Session.refresh`

Each of these are interfaces.  Jakarta Persistence does provide some built-in options:

CacheRetrieveMode:: Is now a `FindOption`.
CacheStoreMode:: Is now a `FindOption` and a `RefreshOption`.
LockModeType:: Is now a `FindOption` and a `RefreshOption`.
Timeout (new):: Is a `FindOption`, a `RefreshOption` and a `LockOption`.  See also `org.hibernate.Timeouts` for some magic values.
PessimisticLockScope:: Is now a `FindOption`, a `RefreshOption` and a `LockOption`

Hibernate provides a few additional options:

ReadOnlyMode (new):: Is a `FindOption` which indicates whether the entities and collections being loaded should be considered read-only.
EnabledFetchProfile (new):: Is a `FindOption` indicating a fetch-profile to be enabled for the find operation.
LockMode:: Is now a `FindOption` and a `RefreshOption` (expanded version of JPA's `LockModeType`).
CacheMode:: Is now a `FindOption`.
BatchSize (new):: Is now a `FindOption`.


All operations which accept options (which previously accepted hints) accept a varargs grouping of them.  E.g.

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
Book loaded = session.find(
    Book.class,
    1,
    LockMode.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE,
    Timeouts.NO_WAIT,
    new EnabledFetchProfile("with-authors")
);
----
====


[[QuerySpecification]]
== QuerySpecification, Restriction, and Range

A new API has been added for incremental definition of a query, with support for selections -

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
SelectionQuery<Book> qry = SelectionSpecification.create(
    Book.class,
    "from Book"
).restrict(
    Restriction.restrict(
        Book_.suggestedCost,
        Range.closed(10.00, 19.99)
    )
).sort(
    Order.asc(Book_.suggestedCost)
).createQuery(session);
----
====

as well as mutations -

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
MutationQuery<Book> qry = MutationSpecification.create(
    Book.class,
    "delete Book"
).restrict(
    Restriction.restrict(
        Book_.suggestedCost,
        Range.closed(10.00, 19.99)
    )
).createQuery(session);
----
====

[NOTE]
====
This feature is considered incubating.
====

See the link:{userGuideBase}#QuerySpecification[User Guide] for details.


[[session-managed-entities]]
== Direct access to first-level cache

The new operation `Session.getManagedEntities()` allows the application to iterate over all entities in the first-level cache, or over all entities of a given type.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is considered incubating.
====


[[enum-checks]]
== Converted Enums and Check Constraints

Hibernate previously added support for generating check constraints for enums mapped using `@Enumerated`
as part of schema generation.  7.0 adds the same capability for enums mapped using an `AttributeConverter`,
by asking the converter to convert all the enum constants on start up.


[[json-xml-functions]]
== JSON and XML functions

Support for most of the JSON and XML functions that the SQL standard specifies was added to HQL/Criteria.
The implementations retain the SQL standard semantics and will throw an error if emulation on a database is impossible.

New functions include:

* construction functions like `json_array()`, `json_object()`, `xmlelement()` and `xmlforest()`
* query functions like `json_value()`, `json_query()` and `xmlquery()`
* aggregation functions like `json_agg()`, `json_object_agg()` and `xmlagg()`
* manipulation functions like `json_set()`, `json_mergepatch()`
* many others


[[set-returning-functions]]
== Set-returning Functions

A set-returning function is a new type of function that can return rows and is exclusive to the `from` clause.
The concept is known in many different database SQL dialects and is sometimes referred to as table valued function or table function.

Custom set-returning functions can be registered via a `FunctionContributor`.
Out-of-the-box, some common set-returning functions are already supported or emulated

* `unnest()` - allows to turn an array into rows
* `generate_series()` - can be used to create a series of values as rows
* `json_table()` - turns a JSON document into rows
* `xmltable()` - turns an XML document into rows


[[any-discriminator]]
== @AnyDiscriminatorImplicitValues

The new  `@AnyDiscriminatorImplicitValues` offers 2 related improvements for the mapping of discriminator values
for `@Any` and `ManyToAny` associations.

First, it allows control over how Hibernate determines the discriminator value to store in the database for
implicit discriminator mappings.  Historically, Hibernate would always use the full name of the associated
entity.

Second, it allows mixing of explicit and implicit value strategies.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is considered incubating.
====

See the link:{userGuideBase}#associations-any[User Guide] for details.


[[stateless-session-multiple]]
== StatelessSession and Batch Operations

`StatelessSession` now supports explicit batch operations via `insertMultiple()`, `updateMultiple()`, or `deleteMultiple()`.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is considered incubating.
====


[[stateless-session-cache]]
== StatelessSession and Second Level Cache

Previously, stateless sessions never interacted with the second-level cache.
This reflected their original intended role in bulk processing.
With the advent of Jakarta Data and Hibernate Data Repositories, the responsibilities of `StatelessSession` have now expanded, and this behavior is no longer appropriate.
Thus, a stateless session now makes use of the second-level cache by default.

See the link:{migrationGuide}#stateless-session-cache[Migration Guide] for additional details.



[[stateless-session-jdbc-batching]]
== StatelessSession and JDBC Batching

Automatic JDBC batching has the side effect of delaying the execution of the batched operation, and this undermines the synchronous nature of operations performed through a stateless session.
In Hibernate 7, the configuration property `hibernate.jdbc.batch_size` now has no effect on a stateless session.
Automatic batching may be enabled by explicitly calling `setJdbcBatchSize()`.
However, the preferred approach is to <<stateless-session-multiple,explicitly batch operations>> via `insertMultiple()`, `updateMultiple()`, or `deleteMultiple()`.


[[transaction-api]]
== Improvements to Transaction

The `Transaction` interface leaks the SPI type `TransactionStatus` via `getStatus()`, and the JTA-defined type `Synchronization` via `registerSynchronization()`, which breaks layering in a fairly harmless way.
New operations were added to the `Transaction` interface, allowing code to inspect the status of the transaction or register callbacks without the use of layer-breaking operations.

[NOTE]
====
This feature is considered incubating.
====

[[collection-id-java-class]]
== @CollectionIdJavaClass

`@CollectionIdJavaClass` is an alternative to `@CollectionIdJavaType` for simpler cases of id-bag mappings.  E.g.

====
[source, java, indent=0]
----
@Bag
@CollectionId(generator="increment")
@CollectionIdJavaClass(Integer.class)
Collection<Person> authors;
----
====


[[schema-manager-populate]]
== Data population

Setting `jakarta.persistence.schema-generation.database.action=populate` or calling `SchemaManager.populate()` populates an existing schema with initial data in `/import.sql` or other SQL scripts specified via `jakarta.persistence.sql-load-script-source`.


[[xml-mapping]]
== XML mappings

Hibernate's legacy `hbm.xml` mapping schema has been deprecated for quite some time, replaced by a new `mapping.xml`
schema, which is now stabilized and should be prefered.
Support for `hbm.xml` mappings will be removed in 8.0.

We offer a transformation of `hbm.xml` files into `mapping.xml` files, which is available both at build-time (Gradle plugin) and at run-time (using `hibernate.transform_hbm_xml.enabled=true`).
